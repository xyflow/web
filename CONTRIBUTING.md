# Contributing to React Flow

Hello there! So glad you want to help out with our documentation ü§ó You‚Äôre the
best. Here‚Äôs a guide for how you can contribute to the project.

# Our Contributing Philosophy

The direction of each of our libraries, which new features are added, and which
are left out, is decided by the core team (sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù
style of development). The core team is paid to do this work
([see how here](https://reactflow.dev/blog/asking-for-money-for-open-source/)).
With this model we ensure that the people doing the most work on the library are
paid for their time and effort, and that we prevent the library from bloating.

That being said, our libraries are only interesting **because of the people who make
things with them** Some of the most important and undervalued work in open source
is from non-code contributions, and that is where we can use the most help from you.

# How can I help?

The things we need the most help for the library and its community are:

**üêõ Bug reports:** We simply can‚Äôt catch them all. Check
[existing issues](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/issues/) and
discussions first, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/issues/new/choose)
to tell us what‚Äôs up.

**üí¨ Answering questions** in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Bqt6xrs) and
[Github discussions](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/discussions). This is
surprisingly high-impact for us! Folks always have questions and we can't always
get round to them all.

üé¨ **Create tutorials** for React Flow. Send them to us and we‚Äôll happily share them!

**‚úèÔ∏è Edit our docs**: This repo contains the docs sites for both React Flow and
Svelte Flow. If you notice a typo or think something can be clearer, you can let
us know by opening an issue or PR here.

All interactions should be done with care following our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Enhancements

If you have an idea or suggestion for an enhancement to the React Flow library,
please use the [New Features](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/discussions/categories/new-features)
discussion section. If you want to build it yourself, **please reach out to us
before you dive into a new pull request.** The direction of React Flow and which
new features are added are discussed in our Discord Server and in
[this Github discussions section](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/discussions/categories/new-features),
and in the end they are decided by the core team.

Talking to us first about the enhancement you want to build will be the most likely
way to get your pull request into the library (see Our Contributing Philosophy
above). We would hate to see you write code you‚Äôre proud of, just to learn that
we‚Äôve already been working on the same thing, or that we feel doesn‚Äôt fit into
the core library.
