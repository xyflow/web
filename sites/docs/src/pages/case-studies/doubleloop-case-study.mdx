<QandA
  className="mt-16"
  question="Can you describe Doubleloop in a sentence?"
  answer="We enable organizations to understand how the work they are doing maps to the
  key outcomes they want to achieve."
/>

<QandA
  question="What problem or decision were you facing that made you decide to use React
  Flow?"
  answer="Developer ergonomics- flexibility in that the library is really solving the
  core of flow-charting and not something more bespoke to their original domain
  problem. Vibrancy of the project development seen through frequency of
  changes, community, bugs / PRs, etc."
/>

<QandA
  question="How are you currently using React Flow?"
  answer="It’s the majority of our core user experience. Our users interact with all the
  of the domain objects in our system via the reactflow pages (we call them
  Maps). We have been leveling up our overall set of interactions to feel as
  natural as FigJam and Miro."
/>

<QandA
  question="Can you give an example of something about React Flow that you have found
  especially useful?"
  answer="It’s the overall ergonomics that feel really nice. The library is opinionated
  on things that I want a flowchart library opinionated on like the overall
  domain modeling of a flow chart library but completely un-opinionated on all
  the things that should be like what exactly is rendered as a Node."
/>

<QandA
  question="Have you experienced any issues or challenges while using the library? If so,
  how were they resolved?"
  answer="Mostly around things that I attribute to the youth of the project. Overall its
  been developing in a great direction that we largely assess by how much custom
  code we get to delete when a new release is out because it’s being handled by
  new internal APIs."
/>

<QandA
  question="How have the features of your React Flow subscription helped you so far?"
  answer="100% Pro examples. Those and the Discord chat have been all we’ve really
  leveraged to date."
