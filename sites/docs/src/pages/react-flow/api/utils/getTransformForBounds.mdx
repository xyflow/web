# getTransformForBounds()

[Source on Github](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/f919cb152dd5a92ec3b4d7e4568ffe099bc2af39/packages/system/src/utils/general.ts#L157)

This util tells you how to transform the viewport to fit the given bounds inside.
It is most commonly used with the [`project`](../types/ReactFlowInstance#project)
and [`zoom`](../types/ReactFlowInstance#zoom) methods on a
[`ReactFlowInstance`](../types/ReactFlowInstance).

```js

```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />

## Notes

- This is quite a low-level utility. You might want to look at the
  [`fitView`](../types/ReactFlowInstance#fitview) or
  [`fitBounds`](../types/ReactFlowInstance#fitbounds) methods for a more practical
  api.
