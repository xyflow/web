# useEdgesState

[Source](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/6d9585c1a62bf549298c83ad5f2dcd6216a5b8eb/packages/core/src/hooks/useNodesEdgesState.ts)

This hook makes it easy to prototype a controlled flow where you manage the
state of nodes and edges outside the `ReactFlowInstance`. You can think of it
like React's `useState` hook with an additional helper callback.

```ts
export function useEdgesState<EdgeData>(
  initialEdges: Edge<EdgeData>[]
): [
  Edge<EdgeData>[],
  Dispatch<SetStateAction<Node<EdgeData>[]>>,
  OnChange<EdgeChange>
];
```

## Parameters

### initialEdges: `Edge<EdgeData>[]`

## Returns

### `[Edge<EdgeData>[], Dispatch<SetStateAction<Edge<EdgeData>[]>>, OnChange<EdgeChange>]`

Returns a three-element tuple containing everything you need to manage edges
within your flow. You can think of this like the familiar `useState` hook but
with an additional `onChange` callback so you don't need to define your own
`onEdgesChange` handler.

0. The first element is the current array of edges. You might pass this directly
   to the `edges` prop of your `<ReactFlow>` component or you may want to
   manipulate it first (for example do some layouting).
1. The second element is a function that you can use to update the edges. You can
   pass it a new array of edges or a callback that receives the current array of
   edges and returns a new array of edges. This is the same as the second element
   of the tuple returned by React's `useState` hook.
2. The third element is a handy callback that can take an array of
   [`EdgeChange`](../types/edge-change)s and update the edges state accordingly.
   You'll typically pass this directly to the `onEdgesChange` prop of your
   `<ReactFlow>` component.

## Types

### `Edge`

Check out our [`types`](../types#reactflowstate) reference for more details on
the `ReactFlowState` type.

### `OnChange`

```ts
type OnChange<ChangesType> = (changes: ChangesType[]) => void;
```

You can pass this callback to the `onEdgesChange` prop of your `<ReactFlow>`
component.

### `EdgeChange`

### `React.Dispatch`

You can find the definition for this type over at DefinitelyTyped
[here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/bdd784f597ef151da8659762300621686969470d/types/react/v17/index.d.ts#L882C17-L882C17).

### `React.SetStateAction`

You can find the definition for this type over at DefinitelyTyped
[here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/bdd784f597ef151da8659762300621686969470d/types/react/v17/index.d.ts#L879).

## Examples

```tsx
import ReactFlow, { useNodesState, useEdgesState } from 'reactflow';

const initialNodes = [];
const initialEdges = [];

export default function () {
  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
    />
  );
}
```

## Notes

- This hook was created to make prototyping easier and our documentation
  examples clearer. Although it is OK to use this hook in production, in
  practice you may want to use a more sophisticated state management solution
  like [Zustand](https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/state-management/) instead.
