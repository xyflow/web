# useKeyPress

[Source](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/6d9585c1a62bf549298c83ad5f2dcd6216a5b8eb/packages/core/src/hooks/useKeyPress.ts)

This hook lets you listen for specific key codes and tells you whether they are
currently pressed or not.

```ts
export function useKeyPress(
  keyCode: KeyCode | null,
  options: UseKeyPressOptions
): boolean;
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useKeyPress } from 'reactflow';

export default function () {
  const spacePressed = useKeyPress('Space');
  const cmdAndSPressed = useKeyPress(['Meta+s', 'Strg+s']);

  return (
    <div>
      {spacePressed && <p>Space pressed!</p>}
      {cmdAndSPressed && <p>Cmd + S pressed!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Parameters

### keyCode?: [`KeyCode | null`](#keycode)

Passing in `null` will unbind any event listeners that were previously set up
by this hook. That way you can conditionally enable ot disable the hook whenever
you need it.

### options?: [`UseKeyPressOptions`](#usekeypressoptions)

## Returns

### `boolean`

Returns true if the provided keycode is pressed (or if any of the provided
keycodes are pressed if an array is passed in) and false otherwise.

## Types

### `KeyCode`

```ts
type KeyCode = string | string[];
```

A single string can represent either an individual key code like `"Space"` or a
combination of codes by combining them with a `"+"` such as `"Ctrl+C"`.

An array of strings represents multiple `KeyCode`s that can trigger the hook,
for example `["Ctrl+C", "Meta+C"]`.

### `UseKeyPressOptions`

```ts
export interface UseKeyPressOptions {
  target: Window | Document | HTMLElement | ShadowRoot | null;
}
```

The `target` property tells the hook what element to attach the keyup and keydown
event listeners to. By default it is the document object, but you may pass in
a different element if you need to.

## Notes

- This hook does not rely on a `ReactFlowInstance` so you are free to use it
  anywhere in your app!
