import { Callout, Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra/components';

# Quickstart

Svelte Flow is a highly customizable component for building interactive graphs and node-based editors, built by the creators of React Flow.

<Callout>
  This package is currently in an alpha state and under heavy development. The
  API is likely to change.
</Callout>

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest version of Svelte Flow is to install it via npm, yarn or pnpm:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @xyflow/svelte
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add @xyflow/svelte
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @xyflow/svelte
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting started

We are working on a new website and everything so there are no docs for Svelte Flow yet. Everything is typed, so your IDE should help you a bit and you can also the [React Flow docs](https://reactflow.dev/docs) because the API is very similar. You can also check out the [Svelte Flow examples](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/tree/xyflow/packages/svelte/src/routes) in this repo.
If you want to start right away you can check out the [Svelte Flow examples Stackblitz project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/svelte-flow-examples?file=src%2Froutes%2Foverview%2F%2Bpage.svelte).

A basic flow looks like this:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    SvelteFlowProvider,
    Controls,
    Background,
    BackgroundVariant,
    MiniMap,
    Panel,
    type NodeTypes
  } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  // We are using writables for the nodes and edges to sync them easily. When a user drags a node for example, Svelte Flow updates its position.
  // This also makes it easier to update nodes in user land.
  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'input',
      data: { label: 'Input Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      type: 'custom',
      data: { label: 'Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 150 }
    }
  ]);

  // same for edges
  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: '1-2',
      type: 'default',
      source: '1',
      target: '2',
      label: 'Edge Text'
    }
  ]);

  const snapGrid = [25, 25];
</script>

<SvelteFlow
  {nodes}
  {edges}
  {nodeTypes}
  fitView
  snapGrid={snapGrid}
  on:nodeclick={(event) => console.log('on node click', event)}
>
  <Controls />
  <Background variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots} />
  <MiniMap />
</SvelteFlow>
```
