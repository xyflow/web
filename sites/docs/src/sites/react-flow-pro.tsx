          React Flow is open-source MIT-licensed software, and it will be
          forever. Our library enables thousands of solo developers and
          organizations like Stripe and Linkedin to build their node-based apps.
          With so many active users, it takes time and effort to maintain the
          library, docs, and community. We canâ€™t do that without your support.
