          in 2019, they developed React Flow and decided to open-source it. More
          and more people started using it, to the point they decided to work on
          it full-time in 2021 to create a sustainable open-source project like
          the many they had used.

          John, Hayleigh, and Peter joined the team to help out with the many
          things that revolve around an open source library. In 2023, we
          generalized the core of React Flow to support other frameworks beyond
          React. In order to keep all of our ducks in a row, we created xyflow
          to be the house where all of our projects could live. Now, here we
          are- happy maintainers of a couple of libraries we&apos;re proud of
          with wonderful communities behind them :)

He woke up on the shores of the Spree, where he wandered into the offices of the newspaper Zeit and they gave him a job as a front-end developer, mistaking him for the potential new hire. He quickly rose through the ranks there. Now he codes at xyFlow, hoping one day he will remember how he got here, and what the meaning of all this is anyway."
