He woke up on the shores of the Spree, where he wandered into the offices of the newspaper Zeit and they gave him a job as a front-end developer, mistaking him for the potential new hire. He quickly rose through the ranks there. Now he codes at xyFlow, hoping one day he will remember how he got here, and what the meaning of all this is anyway."

While she and her 2 cats wait another 7 years until the time machine is re-invented, she decided to take to coding in languages (archaic to her) such as React, Javascript, and Elm. "

Before jumping into the world of open source, UX design and research were his bread and butter. Besides that, he likes looking at birds, playing music, and designing puzzles."
