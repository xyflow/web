description: You can integrate dagre.js with React Flow to create tree layouts. A good alternative to dagre is elkjs if you are looking for a more advanced layouting library.

import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example-with-frontmatter';

<ExampleLayout>
This example shows how you can integrate [dagre.js](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) with React Flow to create simple tree layouts. Good alternatives to dagre are [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy) or [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) if you are looking for a more advanced layouting library.

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="examples/layout/dagre"
  dependencies={{ dagre: 'latest' }}
  activeFile="Flow.svelte"
/>
</ExampleLayout>

This example is a demonstration of _static_ layouting. If the nodes or edges in
the graph change, the layout _won't_ recalculate! It is possible to do dynamic
layouting with dagre (and other libraries), but we don't have an example for
that right now!
