<ExampleLayout>
This example shows how you can integrate [dagre.js](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) with Svelte Flow to create simple tree layouts. Good alternatives to dagre are [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy) or [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) if you are looking for a more advanced layouting library.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/examples/layout/dagre/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/examples/layout/dagre/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
/>

This example is a demonstration of _static_ layouting. If the nodes or edges in
the graph change, the layout _won't_ recalculate! It is possible to do dynamic
layouting with dagre (and other libraries), but we don't have an example for
that right now!
</ExampleLayout>
