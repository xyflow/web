import { RemoteCodeViewer, ExampleLayout } from 'xy-shared';

<ExampleLayout>
Svelte Flow supports rendering nested graphs and grouping of nodes. You can configure the behaviour of the child nodes using `extent: parent` and render group elements without handles by passing `type: group` to the node configuration. See [Sub Flows](/learn/guides/sub-flows) for more information.

  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/layout/subflows/index.html`}
