<ExampleLayout>
Svelte Flow supports rendering nested graphs and grouping of nodes. You can configure the behaviour of the child nodes using `extent: parent` and render group elements without handles by passing `type: group` to the node configuration. See [Sub Flows](/learn/guides/sub-flows) for more information.
