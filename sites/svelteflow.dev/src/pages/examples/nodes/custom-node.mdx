title: Custom Nodes
description: This is an example of a custom node implementation. Svelte Flow nodes are Svelte components, and you can display any content that you want.

import CodeViewer from '@/components/code-viewer';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example';

<ExampleLayout>
Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular Svelte component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behaviour.

<CodeViewer
  codePath="examples/nodes/custom-node"
  framework='svelte'
/>
</ExampleLayout>
