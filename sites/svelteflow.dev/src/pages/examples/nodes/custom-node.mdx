<ExampleLayout>
Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular Svelte component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behaviour.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/nodes/custom-node"
  
  framework="svelte"
/>
</ExampleLayout>

<UnusedPropWarning />
