<ExampleLayout>
This example shows how to automatically create edges when a node is dropped in close proximity to another one. While dragging, a dotted connection line is displayed to show which edge will be created if you drop the node.

  <RemoteCodeViewer
    source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/nodes/proximity-connect/source.json`}
    preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/nodes/proximity-connect/index.html`}
    framework="svelte"
  />
</ExampleLayout>
