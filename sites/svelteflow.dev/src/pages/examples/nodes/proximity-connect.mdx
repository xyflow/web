<ExampleLayout>
This example shows how to automatically create edges when a node is dropped in close proximity to another one. While dragging, a dotted connection line is displayed to show which edge will be created if you drop the node.

  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="examples/nodes/proximity-connect"
    
    framework="svelte"
  />
