import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';
import { ExampleLayout } from 'xy-shared';

import { getStaticCode } from 'xy-shared/server';
export const getStaticProps = getStaticCode(['examples/styling/turbo-flow']);

<ExampleLayout>
Every part of the Svelte Flow UI is customizable. As the name implies the look is taken from the beautiful [turbo.build](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/core-concepts#function-level-caching) website. You can find more information about custom styles in the [theming guide](/learn/guides/theming). (Svelte Flow uses Turborepo and we love it 💜)

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/styling/turbo-flow"
  framework="svelte"
  sandpackOptions={{
    externalResources: ['https://code.cdn.mozilla.net/fonts/fira.css'],
  }}
/>
</ExampleLayout>
