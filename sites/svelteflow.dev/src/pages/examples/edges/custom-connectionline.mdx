<ExampleLayout>
A Connection Line is what you see when you click and drag out from a handle. It represents a possible edge and can snap to valid handles in close proximity.
You can implement your own Connection Line by passing a Svelte component with `slot="connectionLine"`. The `useConnection` hook gives you access to the current `connection`.

<ExampleViewer codePath="examples/edges/custom-connectionline" />
