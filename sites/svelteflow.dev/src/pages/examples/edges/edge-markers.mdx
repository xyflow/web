import { ExampleLayout } from 'xy-shared';

<ExampleLayout>
Svelte Flow has built-in support for different marker types for your edges. It's possible to add your own [SVG markers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker), too.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/edges/edge-markers"
  
  framework="svelte"
/>
</ExampleLayout>
