<ExampleLayout>
You can choose different kinds of [edge types](/api-reference/types/edge) in Svelte Flow: `default` (bezier), `straight`, `step` and `smoothstep`. As you can see, you can define a type for each edge and mix them in one graph.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/edges/edge-types" 
  
  framework="svelte"
/>
</ExampleLayout>
