You may have noticed that the hero flow on our [our homepage](/) is actually written in React 🙈.
For all the non-believers, here it is written in Svelte with help from the [amazing Threlte library](https://threlte.xyz/).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/misc/threlte-flow/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/svelte/examples/misc/threlte-flow/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
/>

</ExampleLayout>

<UnusedPropWarning />
