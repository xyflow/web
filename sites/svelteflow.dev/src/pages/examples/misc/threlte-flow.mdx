You may have noticed that the hero flow on our [our homepage](/) is actually written in React 🙈.
For all the non-believers, here it is written in Svelte with help from the [amazing Threlte library](https://threlte.xyz/).

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/misc/threlte-flow" framework="svelte" />

</ExampleLayout>
