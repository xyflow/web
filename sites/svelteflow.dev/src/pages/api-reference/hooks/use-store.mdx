This hook can be used to access the internal store of the Svelte Flow.

<Callout type="info">
  This hook is only needed for advanced use cases. It should only be used if
  there is no other way to access the internal state. For many of the common use
  cases, there are dedicated hooks available such as
  [`useConnection`](/api-reference/hooks/use-connection),
  [`useNodes`](/api-reference/hooks/use-nodes), etc.
</Callout>

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useStore } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  // lots of props that you pass to the <SvelteFlow> component end up in the internal store.
  // Here we are accessing the current connectionMode.
  const { connectionMode } = useStore();
</script>
```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />
