title: useConnection
description:
  The useConnection hook returns the current connection when there is an active
  connection interaction. If no connection interaction is active, it returns null
  for every property. A typical use case for this hook is to colorize handles
  based on a certain condition (e.g. if the connection is valid or not).

The `useConnection` hook returns the current connection when there is an active connection interaction. If no connection interaction is active, it returns `null` for every property. A typical use case for this hook is to colorize handles based on a certain condition (e.g. if the connection is valid or not).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useConnection } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  const connection = useConnection();
</script>
