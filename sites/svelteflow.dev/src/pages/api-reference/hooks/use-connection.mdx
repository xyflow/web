# useConnection

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/f919cb152dd5a92ec3b4d7e4568ffe099bc2af39/packages/react/src/hooks/useViewport.ts#L13)

The `useConnection` hook returns the current connection when there is an active connection interaction. If no connection interaction is active, it returns `null` for every property. A typical use case for this hook is to colorize handles based on a certain condition (e.g. if the connection is valid or not).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useConnection } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  const connection = useConnection();
</script>
```
