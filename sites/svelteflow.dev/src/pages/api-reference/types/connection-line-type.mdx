# ConnectionLineType

With the `connectionLineType` prop on your [`<SvelteFlow />`](/api-reference/svelte-flow#connection-connectionLineType) component, you can configure the type of the connection line. Svelte Flow comes with built-in support for the following types: 'default' (bezier), 'straight', 'step', 'smoothstep' and 'simplebezier'.

```ts
export enum ConnectionLineType {
  Bezier = 'default',
  Straight = 'straight',
  Step = 'step',
  SmoothStep = 'smoothstep',
  SimpleBezier = 'simplebezier',
}
```
