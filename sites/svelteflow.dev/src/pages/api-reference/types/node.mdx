# Node&lt;T, U>

The `Node` type represents everything Svelte Flow needs to know about a given node.
Many of these properties can be manipulated both by Svelte Flow or by you, but
some such as `width` and `height` should be considered read-only.

```ts
export type Node<T, U extends string> = {
  id: string;
  position: XYPosition;
  data: T;
  type?: U;
  sourcePosition?: Position;
  targetPosition?: Position;
  hidden?: boolean;
  selected?: boolean;
  dragging?: boolean;
  draggable?: boolean;
  selectable?: boolean;
  connectable?: boolean;
  resizing?: boolean;
  deletable?: boolean;
  dragHandle?: string;
  width?: number | null;
  height?: number | null;
  parentNode?: string;
  zIndex?: number;
  extent?: 'parent' | CoordinateExtent;
  expandParent?: boolean;
  positionAbsolute?: XYPosition;
  ariaLabel?: string;
  focusable?: boolean;
  origin?: NodeOrigin;
  style?: string;
  class?: string;
};
```

## Fields

<PropsTable {...nodeFields} />

## Notes

- You shouldn't try to set the `width` or `height` of a node directly. It is
  calculated internally by Svelte Flow and used when rendering the node in the
  viewport. To control a node's size you should use the `style` or `class`
  props to apply CSS styles instead.
