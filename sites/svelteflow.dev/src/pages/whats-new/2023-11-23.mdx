# New release 0.0.28

This is a huge update! We added a new `<NodeToolbar />` component and a new `colorMode` ('light' | 'dark' | 'system') prop for toggling dark/light mode.

There are some breaking changes again (sorry!) but we are very close to the final API for Svelte Flow 1.0.0. The biggest change is that we group node attriubutes (`width`, `height`, `positionAbsolute`) that are added by the library under `node.computed`. This makes it easier to understand, that this stuff comes from the library itself. `node.width` and `node.height` is still an optional node option and can be used to set certain dimensions for SSR or on the client.

- add `<NodeToolbar />` component
- add colorMode prop ('light' | 'dark' | 'system')
- add `on:selectionclick` and `on:selectioncontextmenu` event handlers
- add `ondelete({ nodes, edges })` handler
- add `zoomActivationKey` prop
- add `width` and `height` prop to custom `NodeProps` type
- add `colorMode` prop ('light' | 'dark' | 'system')
- ⚠️ replace `xPos` and `yPos` with `positionAbsolute` prop to custom `NodeProps` type
- ⚠️ `node.width/height` and `node.positionAbsolute` can now be found under `node.computed.width/height/positionAbsolute`
- ⚠️ `node.width/height` is still optional an can be used for forcing certain dimensions and SSR
- refactor keys: you can now disable keys by setting them to `null` (e.g. `selectionKey={null}`)
- performance optimization with internal node lookup
