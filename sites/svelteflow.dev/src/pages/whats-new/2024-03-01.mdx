## 0.0.37

## ⚠️ Breaking changes

- `useNodesData` not only returns data objects but also the type and the id of the node
- status class names for Handle components are slightly different. It's now "connectingfrom" and "connectingto" instead of "connecting"

## Patch changes

- better cursor defaults for the pane, nodes and edges
- add `initialWidth` and `initialHeight` node attributes for specifying initial dimensions for ssr
- always re-measure nodes when new nodes get passed
- fix `NodeResizer` when used in combination with `nodeOrigin`
