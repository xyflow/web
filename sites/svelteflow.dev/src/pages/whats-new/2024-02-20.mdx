# New release 0.0.36

## Patch changes

- a better NodeResizer (child nodes do not move when parent node gets resized)
- fix `on:panecontextmenu`
- add `role="button"` to `<EdgeLabel />` to prevent a11y warnings
- don't delete node when input is focused and user presses Backspace + Ctrl (or any other mod key)
- `useHandleConnections`: use context node id when no node id is passed
- don't trigger drag start / end when node is not draggable
