# getTransformForBounds()

[Source on Github](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow/blob/f919cb152dd5a92ec3b4d7e4568ffe099bc2af39/packages/system/src/utils/general.ts#L157)

This util tells you what to set the viewport to in order to fit the given bounds.
You might use this to pre-calculate the viewport for a given set of nodes on the
server or calculate the viewport for the given bounds _without_ changing the
viewport directly.

```js
@todo
```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />

## Notes

- This is quite a low-level utility. You might want to look at the
  [`fitView`](../types/ReactFlowInstance#fitview) or
  [`fitBounds`](../types/ReactFlowInstance#fitbounds) methods for a more practical
  api.
- This function is called get**Transform**... for historical reasons. Its return
  type represents a [`Viewport`](../types/Viewport) in tuple form.
