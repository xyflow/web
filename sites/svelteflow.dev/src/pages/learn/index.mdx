# Quickstart

Svelte Flow is a highly customizable component for building interactive graphs and node-based editors, built by the creators of React Flow.

<Callout>
  This package is currently in an alpha state and under heavy development. The
  API is likely to change.
</Callout>

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest version of Svelte Flow is to install it via npm, yarn or pnpm:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @xyflow/svelte
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add @xyflow/svelte
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @xyflow/svelte
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating your first flow

We get started by stacking together the most important components of Svelte Flow: `SvelteFlow`, `Controls`, `Background` and `MiniMap`. A basic flow looks like this:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    Controls,
    Background,
    BackgroundVariant,
    MiniMap
  } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  // üëá this is important! You need to import the styles for Svelte Flow to work
  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';

  // We are using writables for the nodes and edges to sync them easily. When a user drags a node for example, Svelte Flow updates its position.
  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'input',
      data: { label: 'Input Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      type: 'default',
      data: { label: 'Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 150 }
    }
  ]);

  // same for edges
  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: '1-2',
      type: 'default',
      source: '1',
      target: '2',
      label: 'Edge Text'
    }
  ]);

  const snapGrid = [25, 25];
</script>

<SvelteFlow
  {nodes}
  {edges}
  {snapGrid}
  fitView
  on:nodeclick={(event) => console.log('on node click', event.detail.node)}
>
  <Controls />
  <Background variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots} />
  <MiniMap />
</SvelteFlow>
```
