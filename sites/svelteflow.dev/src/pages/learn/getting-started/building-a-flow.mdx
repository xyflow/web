# Building a flow

import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';

In the following section we will show you how to create a Svelte component that displays a simple flow. We assume that you've installed Svelte Flow and hope that you are ready to create your first component with Svelte Flow.

## Getting Started

Let's add a `SvelteFlow` component with a `Controls` and a `Background` component. For this we import the components from the `@xyflow/svelte` package:

```js
import { SvelteFlow, Background, Controls } from '@xyflow/svelte';
// 👇 always import the styles
import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
```

Now you can use them in your component like this:

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/a/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/a/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
  editorHeight={400}
/>

You can now pan around by dragging the canvas, as well as zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse or using the control panel buttons.

There are three important things to keep in mind here:

1. You need to **import the styles**. Otherwise Svelte Flow looks weird and doesn't work.
2. The **parent container needs a width and height**, because Svelte Flow uses its parent dimensions.
3. If you have **multiple flows on one page**, you need to pass a unique `id` prop to each component to make Svelte Flow work properly.

## Adding nodes

Now that the basics are set up, we can add a few nodes. For this, you need to create a [writable store](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-store#writable) with an array of [node objects](/api-reference/types/node) like this:

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const nodes = writable([
  {
    id: '1', // required and needs to be a string
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // required
    data: { label: 'hey' }, // required
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    data: { label: 'world' },
  },
]);
```

If we add these nodes to our `SvelteFlow` component, we can see them on the screen:

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/b/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/b/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
  editorHeight={400}
/>

There are lots of options to configure nodes. You can see the full list of options on the [node option site](/api-reference/types/node).

This is a good start! You can already do a lot of things:

- **drag nodes** around
- **select nodes** by clicking on them
- **delete nodes** by pressing the `Backspace` key
- **multi select nodes** by holding down the `Shift` key create a selection box

## Connecting nodes with an edge

Now that we have two nodes, let's connect them with an edge.

To make an edge, we need to specify two attributes: the source node (edge start) and the target node (edge end). We use the `id` of the two nodes to specify this (in our example, our two nodes have ids of "1" and "2"). The edges are stored in a writable store, just like the nodes:

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const edges = writable([{ id: '1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }]);
```

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/c/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/c/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
  editorHeight={400}
/>

Just like nodes, edges have a lot of options too. You can choose a type, define start and end markers, labels, and change the styling. You can see the full list of options on the [edge option site](/api-reference/types/edge).

## Fine-tuning the flow

Now that we have a basic flow, let's fine-tune it a bit. You can automatically fit all nodes into the viewport by using the `fitView` prop.

If you want something besides a white background, you can easily adjust it by using the `bgColor` prop of the `Background` component. As you can see, we also used the `patternColor` prop to change the color of the background pattern. You can also change the pattern with the `variant` prop.

By default the controls panel comes with a zoom-in, zoom-out, fit view and lock button. You can remove the lock button for example by setting `showLock={false}`.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/d/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SVELTE_EXAMPLES_URL}/guides/getting-started/d/index.html`}
  framework="svelte"
  editorHeight={400}
/>

There are way more things you can do! You can get a good overview by checking out the [examples](/examples) or the [API reference](/api-reference).
