# Installation and Requirements

In order to start, you need node.js and npm, yarn or pnpm installed on your machine.
The Svelte Flow package is published on npm under [`@xyflow/svelte`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xyflow/svelte) and installable via:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components';

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @xyflow/svelte
```

Now you can import the Svelte Flow component and the styles in your application:

```js
import { SvelteFlow } from '@xyflow/svelte';

// ðŸ‘‡ this is important! You need to import the styles for Svelte Flow to work
import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
```

## Prior Experience Needed

As the name implies Svelte Flow is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) library. That means Svelte developers will likely find it easy to work with. If youâ€™re not already familiar with fundamental Svelte terms and concepts such as stores, props, and components you may need to get a better understanding of Svelte basics before you can make full use of Svelte Flow. If you've never Svelte React before, we suggest starting your journey with the ["Welcome to Svelte" tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte).
