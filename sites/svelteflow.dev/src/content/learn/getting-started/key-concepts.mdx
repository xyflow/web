# Key Concepts

At its core, Svelte Flow is about creating interactive flowgraphs - a collection of nodes connected by edges. While this might sound simple in theory, Svelte Flow provides the foundation for building complex interactive diagrams:

- An infinite, interactive canvas for your flowgraph
- The ability to render and connect nodes with edges
- **Everything is built using standard Svelte components**

To help you understand the terminology we use throughout the documentation, take a look at the example flow below.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  framework="svelte"
  route="/guides/concepts/"
  showEditor={false}
  showOpenInCodeSandbox={false}
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

Here are the key terms you'll encounter when working with Svelte Flow:

- **Svelte Flow Component**: The main component that renders your flowgraph
  - [**Svelte Flow Props**](/api-reference/svelte-flow): All configuration and data is passed through props
- **Viewport**: The visible area of your flowgraph that can be panned and zoomed
  - When we say something is "in the viewport," it means it moves with the viewport's transformation
- [**Base Styles**](/learn/customization/theming): The essential CSS required for Svelte Flow to function properly
- [**Built-In Components**](/learn/getting-started/built-in-components): Ready-to-use components like Controls and MiniMap that enhance your flowgraph

With these concepts in mind, you're ready to [install Svelte Flow](/learn/getting-started/installation) and start [building your first flow](/learn/getting-started/building-a-flow)!
