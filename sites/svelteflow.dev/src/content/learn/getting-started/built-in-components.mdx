# Built-In Components

Svelte Flow comes with several additional components that you can plug into your flow. All you have to do is import and add them as children to the `SvelteFlow` component.

```svelte filename="BuiltInComponents.svelte"
<script>
  import { SvelteFlow, MiniMap, Controls, Background, Panel } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
</script>

<SvelteFlow>
  <MiniMap />
  <Controls />
  <Background />
  <Panel position="top-left">
    <h1>My Flow</h1>
  </Panel>
</SvelteFlow>
```

## MiniMap

The [`MiniMap`](/api-reference/components/minimap) provides a bird's-eye view of your flowgraph, making navigation easier, especially for larger flows. You can customize the appearance of nodes in the minimap by providing a `nodeColor` function.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/minimap"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

## Controls

Svelte Flow comes with a set of customizable [`Controls`](/api-reference/components/controls) for the viewport. You can zoom in and out, fit the viewport and toggle if the user can move, select and edit the nodes.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/controls"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

## Background

The [`Background`](/api-reference/components/background) component adds a visual grid pattern to your flowgraph, helping users maintain orientation. You can choose from different pattern variants, or if you need more advanced customization, you can explore the [source code](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/plugins/Background/Background.svelte) to implement your own pattern.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/background"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>

## Panel

The [`Panel`](/api-reference/components/panel) component allows you to add fixed overlays to your flowgraph, perfect for titles, controls, or any other UI elements that should remain stationary.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="guides/built-in-components/panel"
  framework="svelte"
  showOpenInStackblitz={false}
/>
