# Installation and Requirements

For this set-up we assume you already have node.js and npm, yarn or pnpm already installed.
The Svelte Flow package is published under [`@xyflow/svelte`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xyflow/svelte) on npm and installable via:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @xyflow/svelte@next
```

Now you can import the Svelte Flow component and the styles in your application:

```js
import { SvelteFlow } from '@xyflow/svelte';
import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
```

## Hit the ground running

To get folks building quickly, we have a template repository on GitHub that uses
Vite and Svelte. You can find the template [here](https://github.com/xyflow/vite-svelte-flow-template).

To use it, you can either create a new repository from the template, or use `degit`
to grab the template's files without the git history:

```bash copy
npx degit xyflow/vite-svelte-flow-template your-app-name
```

## Prior Experience Needed

Svelte Flow is a Svelte library. That means Svelte developers will feel comfortable
using it. If basic Svelte terms and concepts like reactive state, props, components, and
lifecycle methods are unfamiliar to you, you might need to learn more about Svelte before being
able to use Svelte Flow fully. If you've never used Svelte before, we recommend
first getting started on Svelte through the [official tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics).
