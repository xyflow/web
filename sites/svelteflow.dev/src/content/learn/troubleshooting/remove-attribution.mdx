# Remove Attribution

<Callout type="info">
If you‚Äôre considering removing the attribution, we‚Äôd first like to mention:

**If you‚Äôre using Svelte Flow at your organization and making money from it**, we rely on your support to keep Svelte Flow developed and maintained under an MIT License. Before you remove the attribution, [see the ways you can support Svelte Flow to keep it running](/support-us).

**Are you using Svelte Flow for a personal project?** Great! Go ahead and remove the attribution. You can support us by reporting any bugs you find, sending us screenshots of your projects, and starring us on [Github](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow). If you start making money using Svelte Flow or use it in an organization in the future, we would ask that you re-add the attribution or become a Github or Open Collective Sponsor.

Thank you for supporting us ‚úåüèª

- [the xyflow team](https://xyflow.com/about)

</Callout>

To remove our attribution in the corner of your application you can pass `hideAttribution` through `proOptions` prop to the `<SvelteFlow />` component.

```svelte filename="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { SvelteFlow } from '@xyflow/svelte';
  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';
</script>

<SvelteFlow
  proOptions={{ hideAttribution: true }}
/>
```
