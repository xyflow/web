import { Emoji } from '@xyflow/xy-ui';

# Quickstart

If you want to get up and running as soon as possible, you're in the right place! This page will take you from zero to a working Svelte Flow app in a few minutes. From there, you can take a deeper look at what Svelte Flow is all about, check out the examples, or dive into the API docs.

## Dependency

Svelte Flow is published on npm as [`@xyflow/svelte`](https://npmjs.com/package/@xyflow/svelte).

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @xyflow/svelte@next
```

## Play online

You can try Svelte Flow without setting anything up locally by checking out the starter projects we have on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com):

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    title="new.svelteflow.dev/js"
    href="https://new.svelteflow.dev/js"
    icon={
      <div className="rounded-full w-10 h-10 bg-yellow-200 text-gray-700 font-black flex items-center justify-center">
        JS
      </div>
    }
  />
  <Cards.Card
    title="new.svelteflow.dev/ts"
    href="https://new.svelteflow.dev/ts"
    icon={
      <div className="rounded-full w-10 h-10 bg-blue-500 text-white font-black flex items-center justify-center">
        TS
      </div>
    }
  />
</Cards>

## Vite template

If you want to get started right away, you can use our [vite template](https://github.com/xyflow/vite-svelte-flow-template):

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx degit xyflow/vite-svelte-flow-template app-name
```

## Project Setup

To get started locally, you should have a few things:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- Either npm or another package manager like [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or
  [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
- Some knowledge of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). You don't need to be an
  expert, but you should be comfortable with the basics.

First, spin up a new [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) project however you like; we
recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) but the choice is yours.

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx sv create my-svelte-flow-app
```

Then, navigate to your project directory and install the Svelte Flow package:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @xyflow/svelte@next
```

## Creating your first flow

The `@xyflow/svelte` package exports the `<SvelteFlow />` component, which is the entrypoint for you flow.
Importing the default styles and defining a handful of nodes and edges are all we need to get started!

There are a few things to pay attention to here:

- <Emoji content="🎨" /> You must import the Svelte Flow stylesheet.
- <Emoji content="📐" /> `<SvelteFlow />` inherits the size of its parent. Wrap it in an
  element with dimensions.
- <Emoji content="⚡" /> Use
  [`$state.raw`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#$state.raw) instead of deeply
  reactive state for the `nodes` and `edges` for [performance
  reasons](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/11851).

```svelte
<script>
  import { SvelteFlow } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';

  const nodes = $state.raw([
    { id: '1', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: '1' } },
    { id: '2', position: { x: 0, y: 100 }, data: { label: '2' } },
  ]);

  const edges = $state.raw([
    { id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' },
  ]);
</script>

<div style:width="100vh" style:height="100vh">
  <SvelteFlow bind:nodes bind:edges />
</div>
```
