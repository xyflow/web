# Svelte Flow 0.1.5 & 0.1.4

While adding some last minute features to the new React Flow release we also ported them to Svelte Flow and fixed some issues along the way. This includes making `selectable`, `deletable`, `draggable` and `parentId` available as props for custom nodes, fixing panel elements standing in the way of making selection boxes and fixing zoom behaviour on mobile.

## 0.1.5

- prevent zooming on mobile if zoomOnPinch is false
- add `StraightEdge` to built-in path types
- abort drag when multiple touches are detected
- fix merge_styles error

## 0.1.4

- add `selectable`, `deletable` and `draggable` to node and edge props
- add `parentId` to node props
- add `on:edgemouseenter` and `on:edgemouseleave` event handler
- fix deselection of edges
- remove pointer events from panel when user selection is active
- fix viewport initialization with user viewport
- fix parent node lookup in `evaluateAbsolutePosition` - thanks @lcsfort
