# New Release 0.0.29

Another huge update for Svelte Flow üôè Creating data flows will be way easier with the new hooks and functions. You can now subscribe to connected nodes, receive data and update nodes more easily. We fix a big issue about the `<Handle />` component. No more `on:connect` that only worked for target `<Handle />` components but `onconnect` and `ondisconnect` that works for every `<Handle />`.

Check this [Computing Flows example](/examples/interaction/computing-flows) to see the new helpers in action.

### New Features

- add [`useHandleConnections`](/api-reference/hooks/use-handle-connections) hook for receiving connected node and handle ids for a specific handle
- add [`useNodesData(ids: string | string[])`](/api-reference/hooks/use-nodes-data) hook for receiving data from other nodes
- new `updateNode` and `updateNodeData` for [`useSvelteFlow`](/api-reference/hooks/use-svelte-flow) to update a node or the data object
- add `onedgecreate` function for passing a certain id or other attributes to a newly created edge

### Breaking

- replace `on:connect`, `on:connectstart` and `on:connectend` with `onconnect`, `onconnectstart` and `onconnectend`, no need to forward `on:connect..` anymore

### Fixes and minor changes

- `onconnect` and `ondisconnect` callback work for `<Handle />` component
- don't delete a node when user presses Backspace inside an input/textarea/.nokey element
- `bgColor` prop for Background didn't work
- prefix css vars with "xy-"
- don't update nodes and edges on pane click if not necessary
- cleaner types for exported edges
- fix `getIntersectingNodes` bug when passing `Rect`
