# Release notes: 0.0.39

## ⚠️ Breaking changes

- `on:nodedragstart`, `on:nodedrag` and `on:nodedragstop` are also getting fired if a selection bix is being dragged. We renamed the `node` param to `targetNode` and set it to `null` if a selection is being dragged.

## Minor changes

- add [`EdgeLabel`](/api-reference/components/edge-label) component

## Patch changes

- add "connectionindicator" class for `Handle` component
- address a11y warnings
