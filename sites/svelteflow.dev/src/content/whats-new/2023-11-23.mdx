# New release 0.0.28

This is a huge update! We added a new [`<NodeToolbar />` component](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar) and a new `colorMode` ('light' | 'dark' | 'system') prop for toggling dark/light mode. Check out the [new dark mode example](/examples/styling/dark-mode).

There are some breaking changes again (sorry!) but we are very close to the final API for Svelte Flow 1.0.0. The biggest change is that we group node attriubutes (`width`, `height`, `positionAbsolute`) that are added by the library under `node.computed`. This makes it easier to understand, that this stuff comes from the library itself. `node.width` and `node.height` is still an optional node option and can be used to set certain dimensions for SSR or on the client.

- add `<NodeToolbar />` component
- add colorMode prop ('light' | 'dark' | 'system') - [Dark mode example]
- add `on:selectionclick` and `on:selectioncontextmenu` event handlers
- add `ondelete({ nodes, edges })` handler
- add `zoomActivationKey` prop
- add `width` and `height` prop to custom `NodeProps` type
- add `colorMode` prop ('light' | 'dark' | 'system')
- ⚠️ replace `xPos` and `yPos` with `positionAbsolute` prop to custom `NodeProps` type
- ⚠️ `node.width/height` and `node.positionAbsolute` can now be found under `node.computed.width/height/positionAbsolute`
- ⚠️ `node.width/height` is still optional an can be used for forcing certain dimensions and SSR
- refactor keys: you can now disable keys by setting them to `null` (e.g. `selectionKey={null}`)
- performance optimization with internal node lookup
