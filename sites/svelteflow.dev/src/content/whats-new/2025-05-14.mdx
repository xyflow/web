# Yeah! Svelte Flow 1.0. is here ðŸš€

Svelte Flow 1.0 is based on Svelte 5 and introduces a lot of new features and improvements. Please refer to the [migration guide](/learn/troubleshooting/migrate-to-v1) to see how to upgrade.

### New features

- **[Reconnect edges](/examples/edges/reconnect-edge)**: You can reconnect your edges by using the new `<EdgeReconnectAnchor />` component. It can be used to add custom reconnection points on custom edges.
- **Keyboard navigation & A11y**: We added support for keyboard navigation and improved accessibility for screen readers. You can now tab through nodes and edges and move nodes with the arrow keys. Can be disabled via [**disableKeyboardA11y**](/api-reference/svelte-flow#disablekeyboarda11y)
- **[Click connect](/examples/edges/click-connect)**: You can now create a new connection by clicking on a handle one by one.
- **[Enhanced ViewportPortal](/api-reference/components/viewport-portal)**: You can now decide if you want to render something below or above the nodes & edges in the viewport.
- **Improved [fitView](/api-reference/hooks/use-svelte-flow#fitview)**: We finetuned the `fitView` function to better work with dynamically added nodes.
- **colorModeSSR** prop: You can pass a fallback color mode for server side rendering when colorMode is set to system.
- [**elevateNodesOnSelect**](/api-reference/svelte-flow#elevateNodesOnSelect) & [**elevateEdgesOnSelect**](/api-reference/svelte-flow#elevateEdgesOnSelect): Control if nodes & edges should be elevated via z-index when selected.
- [**noDragClass, noWheelClass, noPanClass**](/api-reference/svelte-flow#style-props): You can now modify the class name used to disable dragging, panning and zooming.
- [**onselectionchange**](/api-reference/svelte-flow#onselectionchange) & [**useOnSelectionChange**](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference/hooks/use-on-selection-change): You can now listen to selection changes via a callback
