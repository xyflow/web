# New release 0.0.27

We just released Svelte Flow 0.0.27 with some breaking changes. Even if we try to avoid them, they will happen. We just renamed some functions, so the migration should go easy. Here is a list of all changes:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è rename `screenToFlowCoordinate` to `screenToFlowPosition`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è rename `flowToScreenCoordinate` to `flowToScreenPosition`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è rename `getTransformForBounds` to `getViewportForBounds` (return `{ x: number, y: number, zoom: number }` instead of `[number, number, number]`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è rename `getRectOfNodes` to `getNodesBounds`
- simplify handle default styles, so that it's easier to override them
- add `selectionOnDrag` prop - can be used to create figma-like controls in combination with `panOnDrag={false}` / `panOnDrag={[1, 2]}` + `panOnScroll={true}`
- üéâ add e2e tests
