The `useConnection` hook returns the current connection when there is an active connection
interaction. If no connection interaction is active, it returns `null` for every property.
A typical use case for this hook is to colorize handles based on a certain condition (e.g.
if the connection is valid or not).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useConnection } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  const connection = useConnection();
</script>
```
