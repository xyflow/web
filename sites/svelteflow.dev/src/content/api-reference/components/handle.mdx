# &lt;Handle />

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/components/Handle/Handle.svelte)

The `<Handle />` component is used in your [custom nodes](/learn/customization/custom-nodes)
to define connection points.

```svelte filename="CustomNode.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { Handle, Position, type NodeProps } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  let { data } : NodeProps = $props();
</script>

<div>
  {data.label}
</div>

<Handle type="target" position={Position.Left} />
<Handle type="source" position={Position.Right} />
```

## Props

The type for props of `<Handle />` component is exported as `HandleProps`. Additionally, it extends the props of `<div />`.

<APIDocs componentName="Handle" groupKeys="HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>" />

## Examples

### Custom handle with validation

You can create your own custom handles by wrapping the `<Handle />` component.
This example shows a custom handle that only allows connections when the
connection source matches a given id.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { Handle, type HandleProps  } from '@xyflow/svelte';

	let { source, ...rest } : HandleProps = $props();

	function isValidConnection(connection) {
		return connection.source === source;
	}
</script>

<Handle
	type="target"
	{isValidConnection}
	{...rest}
/>
```

### Style handles when connecting

The handle receives the additional class names `connecting` when the connection
line is above the handle and `valid` if the connection is valid. You can find an
example which uses these classes [here](/examples/interaction/validation).

### Multiple handles

If you need multiple source or target handles you can achieve this by creating a
custom node. Normally you just use the id of a node for the `source` or `target`
of an edge. If you have multiple source or target handles you need to pass an id
to these handles. These ids can be used by an edge with the `sourceHandle` and
`targetHandle` options, so that you can connect a specific handle. If you have a
node with `id: 'node-1'` and a handle with `id: 'handle-1'` you can connect an edge to this handle
by defining it with `source: 'node-1'` and `sourceHandle: 'hadnle-1'`.

### Dynamic handles

If you are programmatically changing the position or number of handles in your
custom node, you need to update the node internals with the
[`useUpdateNodeInternals`](/api-reference/hooks/use-update-node-internals) hook.

You can find an example of how to implement a custom node with multiple handles
in the [custom node guide](/learn/customization/custom-nodes) or in the
[custom node example](/examples/nodes/custom-node).

### Custom handle styles

Since the handle is a div, you can use CSS to style it or pass a style prop to
customize a Handle. You can see this in the
[Add Node On Edge Drop](/examples/nodes/add-node-on-edge-drop) and
[Simple Floating Edges](/examples/edges/simple-floating-edges) examples.
