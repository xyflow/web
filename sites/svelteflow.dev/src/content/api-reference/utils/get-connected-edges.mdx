Given an array of nodes that may be connected to one another and an array of
_all_ your edges, this util gives you an array of edges that connect any of the
given nodes together.

```js
import { getConnectedEdges } from '@xyflow/svelte';

let nodes = $state.raw([]);
let edges = $state.raw([]);

const connectedEdges = getConnectedEdges(nodes.value, edges.value);
```
