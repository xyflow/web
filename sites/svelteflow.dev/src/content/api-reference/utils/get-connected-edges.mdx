Given an array of nodes that may be connected to one another and an array of
_all_ your edges, this util gives you an array of edges that connect any of the
given nodes together.

```js
import { getConnectedEdges } from '@xyflow/svelte';

const nodes = [];
const edges = [];

const connectedEdges = getConnectedEdges(nodes, edges);
```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />
