[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/utils/graph.ts/#L121-L137)

This util is used to tell you what nodes, if any, are connected to the given node
as the _source_ of an edge.

```ts
import { getIncomers } from '@xyflow/svelte';

let nodes = $state.raw([]);
let edges = $state.raw([]);

const incomers = getIncomers(
  { id: '1', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: 'node' } },
  nodes.value,
  edges.value,
);
```
