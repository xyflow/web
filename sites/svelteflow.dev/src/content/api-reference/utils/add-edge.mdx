This util is a convenience function to add a new [`Edge`](/api-reference/types/edge) to an
array of edges. It also performs some validation to make sure you don't add an
invalid edge or duplicate an existing one.

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
import { addEdge } from '@xyflow/svelte';

const edges = writable([]);

const onAddEdge = () => {
  const newEdge = {
    id: '1-2',
    source: '1',
    target: '2'
  };
  $edges = addEdge(newEdge, $edges);
}
```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />

## Notes

- If an edge with the same `target` and `source` already exists (and the same
  `targetHandle` and `sourceHandle` if those are set), then this util won't add
  a new edge even if the `id` property is different.
