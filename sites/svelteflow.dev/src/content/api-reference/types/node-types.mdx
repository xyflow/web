# NodeTypes

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/types/nodes.ts#L33)

The `NodeTypes` type is a record that maps node type identifiers to their corresponding Svelte components. This allows you to define custom node types and their implementations.

```ts
type NodeTypes = Record<string, SvelteComponent>;
```
