# Node&lt;NodeData, NodeType>

The `Node` type represents everything Svelte Flow needs to know about a given node.
Many of these properties can be manipulated both by Svelte Flow or by you, but
some such as `width` and `height` should be considered read-only.

```ts
export type Node<
  NodeData extends Record<string, unknown>,
  NodeType extends string,
> = {
  id: string;
  position: XYPosition;
  data: NodeData;
  type?: NodeType;
  sourcePosition?: Position;
  targetPosition?: Position;
  hidden?: boolean;
  selected?: boolean;
  dragging?: boolean;
  draggable?: boolean;
  selectable?: boolean;
  connectable?: boolean;
  resizing?: boolean;
  deletable?: boolean;
  dragHandle?: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  parentId?: string;
  zIndex?: number;
  extent?: 'parent' | CoordinateExtent;
  ariaLabel?: string;
  origin?: NodeOrigin;
  style?: string;
  class?: string;
  measured?: {
    width?: number;
    height?: number;
  };
};
```

## Fields

<PropsTable {...nodeFields} />

## Notes

- You shouldn't try to set the `measured.width` or `measured.height` of a node directly. It is
  measured internally by Svelte Flow and used when rendering the node in the
  viewport. To control a node's size you should use the `width` and `height`
  attributes.
