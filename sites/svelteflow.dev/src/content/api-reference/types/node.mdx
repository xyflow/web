# Node\<NodeData, NodeType>

The `Node` type represents everything Svelte Flow needs to know about a given node.
Many of these properties can be manipulated both by Svelte Flow or by you, but
some such as `width` and `height` should be considered read-only.

## Fields

<APIDocs typeName="Node" />

## Notes

- You shouldn't try to set the `measured.width` or `measured.height` of a node directly. It is
  measured internally by Svelte Flow and used when rendering the node in the
  viewport. To control a node's size you should use the `width` and `height`
  attributes.
