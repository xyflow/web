# Node\<NodeData, NodeType>

The `Node` type represents everything Svelte Flow needs to know about a given node.

## Notes

- You shouldn't try to set the `measured.width` or `measured.height` of a node directly. It is
  measured internally by Svelte Flow and used when rendering the node in the
  viewport. To control a node's size you should use the `width` and `height`
  attributes.
