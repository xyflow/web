The `OnReconnect` type is a callback function that is called when an existing edge is reconnected to a different node or handle. It receives the old edge and the new connection details.

```ts
type OnReconnect<EdgeType extends EdgeBase = EdgeBase> = (
  oldEdge: EdgeType,
  newConnection: Connection,
) => void;
```
