# SelectionMode

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L223)

The `SelectionMode` enum determines how node selection works. Use `Full` to require the entire node to be within the selection area, or `Partial` to allow overlap.

```ts
enum SelectionMode {
  Partial = 'partial',
  Full = 'full',
}
```
