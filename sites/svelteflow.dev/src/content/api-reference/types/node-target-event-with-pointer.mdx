# NodeTargetEventWithPointer

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/types/events.ts#20)

The `NodeTargetEventWithPointer` type represents an event that occurs during target node interactions, including pointer position and event details. It extends the base node event with pointer-specific information and target node data.

```ts
type NodeTargetEventWithPointer<NodeType extends Node = Node> = {
  event: PointerEvent;
  node: NodeType;
  targetNode: NodeType;
};
```
