# EdgeTypes

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/types/edges.ts#L140)

The `EdgeTypes` type is a record that maps edge type identifiers to their corresponding Svelte components. This allows you to define custom edge types and their implementations.

```ts
type EdgeTypes = Record<string, SvelteComponent>;
```
