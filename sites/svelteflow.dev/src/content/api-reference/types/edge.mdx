# Edge&lt;T>

An `Edge` is the complete description with everything Svelte Flow needs to know in order to render it.

```ts
export type Edge<T> =
  | DefaultEdge<T>
  | SmoothStepEdgeType<T>
  | BezierEdgeType<T>;
```

## Variants

### DefaultEdge&lt;T>

<PropsTable {...defaultEdgeFields} />

### SmoothStepEdgeType&lt;T>

The `SmoothStepEdgeType` variant has all the same fields as the `DefaultEdge`
variant, but it also has the following additional fields:

<PropsTable {...smoothStepEdgeTypeFields} />

### BezierEdgeType&lt;T>

The `BezierEdgeType` variant has all the same fields as the `DefaultEdge` variant,
but it also has the following additional fields:

<PropsTable {...bezierEdgeTypeFields} />
