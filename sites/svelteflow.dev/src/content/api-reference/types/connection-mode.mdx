# ConnectionMode

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L68)

The `ConnectionMode` enum defines the available strategies for connecting nodes. Use `Strict` to only allow connections to valid handles, or `Loose` to allow more flexible connections.

```ts
enum ConnectionMode {
  Strict = 'strict',
  Loose = 'loose',
}
```
