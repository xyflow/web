# OnBeforeDelete

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/types/general.ts#L38)

The `OnBeforeDelete` type is a callback function that is called before nodes or edges are deleted. It can prevent deletion or modify the items to be deleted by returning `false` or a modified set of nodes and edges.

```ts
type OnBeforeDelete<
  NodeType extends NodeBase = NodeBase,
  EdgeType extends EdgeBase = EdgeBase,
> = ({
  nodes,
  edges,
}: {
  nodes: NodeType[];
  edges: EdgeType[];
}) => Promise<boolean | { nodes: NodeType[]; edges: EdgeType[] }>;
```
