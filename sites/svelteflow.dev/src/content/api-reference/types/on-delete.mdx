# OnDelete

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/lib/types/general.ts##L26)

The `OnDelete` type is a callback function that is called when nodes or edges are deleted from the flow. It receives the deleted nodes and edges.

```ts
type OnDelete<
  NodeType extends NodeBase = NodeBase,
  EdgeType extends EdgeBase = EdgeBase,
> = ({ nodes, edges }: { nodes: NodeType[]; edges: EdgeType[] }) => void;
```

<APIDocs typeName="OnDelete" packageName="svelte" />
