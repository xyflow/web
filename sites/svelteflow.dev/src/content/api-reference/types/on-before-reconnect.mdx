# OnBeforeReconnect

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/lib/types/general.ts#L34)

The `OnBeforeReconnect` type is a callback function that is called before an edge is reconnected. It can prevent reconnection or modify the connection by returning `false` or a modified connection.

```ts
type OnBeforeReconnect<EdgeType extends EdgeBase = EdgeBase> = (
  oldEdge: EdgeType,
  newConnection: Connection,
) => Promise<boolean | Connection>;
```
