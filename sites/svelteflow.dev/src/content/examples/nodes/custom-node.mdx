Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular Svelte component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behavior.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/nodes/custom-node" framework="svelte" />

<UnusedPropWarning />
