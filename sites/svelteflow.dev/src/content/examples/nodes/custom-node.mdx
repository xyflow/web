title: Custom Nodes
description: This is an example of a custom node implementation. Svelte Flow nodes are Svelte components, and you can display any content that you want.

Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular Svelte component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behavior.

<UnusedPropWarning />
