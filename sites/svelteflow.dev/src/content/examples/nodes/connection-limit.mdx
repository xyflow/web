This is an example of a custom node with a custom handle that can limit the amount of connections a handle can have using the `isConnectable` prop.
You can use a boolean, a number (the number of max. connections the handle should have) or a callback function that returns a boolean
as an arg for the `isConnectable` prop of the CustomHandle component.
