Every part of the Svelte Flow UI is customizable. As the name implies the look is taken from the beautiful [turbo.build](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/core-concepts#function-level-caching) website. You can find more information about custom styles in the [theming guide](/learn/guides/theming). (Svelte Flow uses Turborepo and we love it ðŸ’œ)
