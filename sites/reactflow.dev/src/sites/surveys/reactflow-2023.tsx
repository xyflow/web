            Our users felt state management was difficult to get right in React
            Flow. There&apos;s a lot of confusion around what state is managed
            by React Flow versus what state should be managed by the user, and
            then there are questions about what library or approach to use for
            state management!

            One reason why folks might think the pricing is too high is that we
            currently don&apos;t offer{' '}
            <span className="italic">region-based pricing</span>. Our
            subscription is affordable to businesses in Europe or the US, but if
            you&apos;re in India or Brazil, it&apos;s significantly more
            expensive.

            For the folks that <span className="font-bold">didn&apos;t</span>{' '}
            subscribe to React Flow Pro, the most common reason was its price.
            We cater our Pro subscription around businesses because those are
            the folks with the money available to keep React Flow sustainable,
            but that can mean our pricing feels unfair to individuals or small
            teams.

            We offer discounts for early stage startups, and{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">students and open source projects</span>{' '}
            can access Pro Examples on request.

            Some people were unhappy about the subscription model and would
            prefer a one-time payment. Our Pro platform is constantly improving
            and we are regularly adding new examples! The Pro subscription is
            what allows us to keep working on React Flow as a job and keep the
            library MIT licensed: having that recurring revenue makes all that
            possible.
