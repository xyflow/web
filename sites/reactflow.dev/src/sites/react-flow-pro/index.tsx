          <strong>React Flow is open-source MIT-licensed software</strong>, and
          it will be forever. Our library enables thousands of solo developers
          and organizations like Stripe and Linkedin to build their node-based
          apps. With so many active users, it takes time and effort to maintain
          the library, docs, and community. We canâ€™t do that without your
          support.
