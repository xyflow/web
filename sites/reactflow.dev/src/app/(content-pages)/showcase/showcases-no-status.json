This allows instant graph sharing and state transfer without any database or auth layer.  What started as a learning tool quickly turned into a frontend engineering challenge — implementing weighted and unweighted traversal, grid and freeform graph modes, live animation controls, terrain generation with solvable constraints, and onboarding UX that scales.  I also spent time understanding how learners interact with visual tools, refining the UI to be not just interactive but instructive. NextPath is designed for students, interview preppers, and educators alike.  This project helped me deeply understand data structure visualization, state management patterns (Zustand), and libraries like React Flow and Framer Motion — all while pushing myself to build a product that teaches by doing.",
