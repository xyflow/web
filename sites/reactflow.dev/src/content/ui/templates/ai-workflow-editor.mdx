# AI Workflow Editor

The AI Workflow Editor template is a Next.js template for getting started quickly with an
AI workflow app. It's based on our
[workflow editor template](/ui/templates/workflow-editor), [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/)
and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Tech Stack

- **React Flow UI**: The project uses [React Flow UI](/ui) for the nodes. These components
  are designed to help you quickly get up to speed on projects.

- **shadcn CLI**: The project uses [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) to manage
  UI components. This tool builds on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and
  [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, making it easy to add and customize UI
  elements.

- **AI SDK**: The template uses [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) to provide AI-powered
  features within the workflow editor.

- **State Management with Zustand**: The AI workflow editor template uses Zustand for
  state management, providing a simple and efficient way to manage the state of nodes,
  edges, and other workflow-related data.
