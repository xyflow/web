# React Flow UI

Ready-to-use React Flow components built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
components and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Useful for new projects, MVPs, or
when you need to get up and running quickly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> React Flow UI has been updated to support the latest version of shadcn/ui, on **React 19
> and Tailwind 4**! Read more about the changes and how to upgrade
> [here](/whats-new/2025-10-28).

## Prerequisites

You need to have **shadcn and tailwind configured in your project**. If you haven't
installed it, you can follow the steps explained in the
[shadcn installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation). If shadcn and
tailwind are part of your project, you can initialize shadcn-ui by running:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest init
```

If you want to learn more about the motivation behind this project, you can find a
detailed blog post [here](https://xyflow.com/blog/react-flow-components). For a more
in-depth tutorial, we also recently published a new guide on
[getting started with React Flow UI](/learn/tutorials/getting-started-with-react-flow-components).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Using React Flow UI components with Tailwind CSS 4 **requires importing the
> main React Flow CSS stylesheet** after you import the **shadcn UI
> stylesheet**. To ensure the styles are loaded in the correct order, you should
> always import the styles in your `global.css` file (or `index.css` file),
> after you import `tailwindcss`. **Avoid importing the styles in your `App.tsx`
> file or any other file that is imported by your `App.tsx` file.**


```tsx filename="global.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "tw-animate-css";
@layer base {
  @import "@xyflow/react/dist/style.css";
}
```

## Usage

Find a component you like and run the command to add it to your project.

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name
```

- This command copies the component code inside your components folder. You can change
  this folder by adding an alias inside your `components.json`.

- It automatically installs all necessary dependencies

- It utilizes previously added and even modified components or asks you if you'd like to
  overwrite them.

- It uses your existing tailwind configuration.

- The components are **not black-boxes** and can be **modified and extended** to fit your
  needs.
