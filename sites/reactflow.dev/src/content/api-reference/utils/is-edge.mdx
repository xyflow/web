# isEdge()

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/utils/graph.ts/#L39-L40)

Test whether an object is usable as an [`Edge`](/api-reference/types/edge). In TypeScript
this is a type guard that will narrow the type of whatever you pass in to
[`Edge`](/api-reference/types/edge) if it returns `true`.

```js
import { isEdge } from '@xyflow/react';

const edge = {
  id: 'edge-a',
  source: 'a',
  target: 'b',
};

if (isEdge(edge)) {
  // ...
}
```

## Signature

<APIDocs functionName="isEdge" />
