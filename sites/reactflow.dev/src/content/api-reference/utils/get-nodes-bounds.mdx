# getNodesBounds()

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/utils/graph.ts/#L133)

Returns the bounding box that contains all the given nodes in an array. This can
be useful when combined with [`getViewportForBounds`](/api-reference/utils/get-viewport-for-bounds)
to calculate the correct transform to fit the given nodes in a viewport.

```js
import { getNodesBounds } from '@xyflow/react';

const nodes = [
  {
    id: 'a',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: { label: 'a' },
    width: 50,
    height: 25,
  },
  {
    id: 'b',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    data: { label: 'b' },
    width: 50,
    height: 25,
  },
];

const bounds = getNodesBounds(nodes);
