# DeleteElements

DeleteElements deletes provided nodes and edges and handles deleting any connected edges as well as child nodes. Returns successfully deleted edges and nodes asynchronously.

```ts
export type DeleteElements = (payload: {
  nodes?: (Partial<Node> & { id: Node['id'] })[];
  edges?: (Partial<Edge> & { id: Edge['id'] })[];
}) => Promise<{
  deletedNodes: Node[];
  deletedEdges: Edge[];
}>;
```
