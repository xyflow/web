# SelectionMode

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L223)

The `SelectionMode` enum provides two options for node selection behavior:

- `Full`: A node is only selected when the selection rectangle fully contains it
- `Partial`: A node is selected when the selection rectangle partially overlaps with it

```ts
enum SelectionMode {
  Partial = 'partial',
  Full = 'full',
}
```
