# NodeTypes

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/types/nodes.ts)

The `NodeTypes` type is used to define custom node types. Each key in the object represents a node type, and the value is the component that should be rendered for that type.

```ts
type NodeTypes = {
  [key: string]: React.ComponentType<NodeProps>;
};
```
