# OnBeforeDelete

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/types/general.ts#L207)

The `OnBeforeDelete` type defines the callback function that is called before nodes or edges are deleted. This callback receives an object containing the nodes and edges that are about to be deleted.

```ts
type OnBeforeDelete = (params: {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
}) => Promise<boolean | {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
})>;
```
