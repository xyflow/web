# NodeHandle

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/13897512d3c57e72c2e27b14ffa129412289d948/packages/system/src/types/nodes.ts#L139)

The `NodeHandle` type is used to define a handle for a node if server-side rendering is used. On the server, React Flow can't measure DOM nodes, so it's necessary to define the handle position dimensions.
