# OnReconnectEnd

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L89)

The `OnReconnectEnd` type is a callback that fires when the reconnection process for an edge is completed or canceled. It receives the triggering event, the edge, the handle type, and the final connection state.

```ts
type OnReconnectEnd<EdgeType extends EdgeBase = EdgeBase> = (
  event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent,
  edge: EdgeType,
  handleType: HandleType,
  connectionState: FinalConnectionState,
) => void;
```
