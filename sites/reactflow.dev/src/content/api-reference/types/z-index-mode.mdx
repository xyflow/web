# ZIndexMode

The ZIndexMode type is used to define how z-indexing is calculated for nodes and edges.

- `auto` mode will automatically manage z-indexing for selections and sub flows.
- `basic` mode will only manage z-indexing for selections.
- `manual` mode does not apply any automatic z-indexing.

```ts
export type ZIndexMode = 'auto' | 'basic' | 'manual';
```
