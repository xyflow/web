[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L157)

The `SnapGrid` type defines the grid size for snapping nodes on the pane. It is used in conjunction with the `snapToGrid` prop to enable grid snapping functionality.

```ts
type SnapGrid = [number, number];
```
