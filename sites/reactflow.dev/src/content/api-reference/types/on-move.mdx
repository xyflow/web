# OnMove

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L16)

The `OnMove` type is a callback that fires whenever the viewport is moved, either by user interaction or programmatically. It receives the triggering event and the new viewport state.

```ts
type OnMove = (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent | null, viewport: Viewport) => void;
```
