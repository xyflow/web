[Source on Github](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/v11/packages/node-resizer/src/types.ts/#L4)

The `ResizeParams` type is used to type the various events that are emitted by the
`<NodeResizer />` component. You'll sometimes see this type extended with an additional
direction field too.

```ts
export type ResizeParams = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
};
```

## Fields

<PropsTable {...resizeParamsFields} />
