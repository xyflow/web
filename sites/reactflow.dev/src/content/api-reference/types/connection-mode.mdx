# ConnectionMode

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L68)

The `ConnectionMode` enum provides two options for connection behavior in React Flow:

- `Strict`: Connections can only be made starting from a source handle and ending on a target handle
- `Loose`: Connections can be made between any handles, regardless of type

```ts
enum ConnectionMode {
  Strict = 'strict',
  Loose = 'loose',
}
```
