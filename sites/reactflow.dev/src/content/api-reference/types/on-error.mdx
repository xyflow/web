[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts#L233)

The `OnError` type defines the callback function that is called when an error occurs. This callback receives an error id and the error message as its argument.

```ts
type OnError = (id: string, error: string) => void;
```
