# Node

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/nodes.ts/#L10)

The `Node` type represents everything React Flow needs to know about a given node.
Many of these properties can be manipulated both by React Flow or by you, but
some such as `width` and `height` should be considered read-only.

## Fields

<APIDocs typeName="Node" packageName="react" />

## Default node types

You can create any of React Flow's default nodes by setting the `type` property
to one of the following values:

- `"default"`
- `"input"`
- `"output"`
- `"group"`

If you don't set the `type` property at all, React Flow will fallback to the
`"default"` node with both an input and output port.

These default nodes are available even if you set the [`nodeTypes`](/api-reference/react-flow#node-types)
prop to something else, unless you override any of these keys directly.

## Notes

- You shouldn't try to set the `width` or `height` of a node directly. It is
  calculated internally by React Flow and used when rendering the node in the
  viewport. To control a node's size you should use the `style` or `className`
  props to apply CSS styles instead.
