# PanelPosition

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts/#L111-L112)

This type is mostly used to help position things on top of the flow viewport. For
example both the [`<MiniMap />`](/api-reference/components/minimap) and
[`<Controls />`](/api-reference/components/controls) components take a `position`
prop of this type.

```ts
export type PanelPosition =
  | 'top-left'
  | 'top-center'
  | 'top-right'
  | 'bottom-left'
  | 'bottom-center'
  | 'bottom-right'
  | 'center-left'
  | 'center-right';
```
