# ConnectionLineComponent

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/types/edges.ts#L265)

The `ConnectionLineComponent` type allows you to provide a custom React component to render the connection line when users create new edges. The component receives `ConnectionLineComponentProps` as its props.

```ts
type ConnectionLineComponent = React.ComponentType<ConnectionLineComponentProps>;
```
