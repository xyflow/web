[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/types/general.ts#L59)

The `OnDelete` type defines the callback function that is called when nodes or edges are deleted. This callback receives an object containing the deleted nodes and edges.

```ts
type OnDelete = (params: { nodes: Node[]; edges: Edge[] }) => void;
```

<APIDocs typeName="OnDelete" packageName="react" />
