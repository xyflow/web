# IsValidConnection

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/types/general.ts#L212)

The `IsValidConnection` type represents a function that validates whether a connection between nodes is allowed. It receives a [`Connection`](/api-reference/types/connection) and returns a boolean indicating whether the connection is valid and therefore should be created.

```ts
type IsValidConnection = (edge: Edge | Connection) => boolean;
```
