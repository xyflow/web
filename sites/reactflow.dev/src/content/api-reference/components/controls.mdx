# \<Controls />

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/additional-components/Controls/Controls.tsx)

The `<Controls />` component renders a small panel that contains convenient
buttons to zoom in, zoom out, fit the view, and lock the viewport.

```tsx
import { ReactFlow, Controls } from '@xyflow/react'

export default function Flow() {
  return (
    <ReactFlow nodes={[...]} edges={[...]}>
      <Controls />
    </ReactFlow>
  )
}
```

## Props

For TypeScript users, the props type for the `<Controls />` component is exported
as `ControlProps`.

<APIDocs componentName="Controls" />

## Notes

- To extend or customize the controls, you can use the [`<ControlButton />`](/api-reference/components/control-button)
  component
