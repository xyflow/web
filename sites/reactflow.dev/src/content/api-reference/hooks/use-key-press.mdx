# useKeyPress()

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/hooks/useKeyPress.ts)

This hook lets you listen for specific key codes and tells you whether they are
currently pressed or not.

```jsx
import { useKeyPress } from '@xyflow/react';

export default function () {
  const spacePressed = useKeyPress('Space');
  const cmdAndSPressed = useKeyPress(['Meta+s', 'Strg+s']);

  return (
    <div>
      {spacePressed && <p>Space pressed!</p>}
      {cmdAndSPressed && <p>Cmd + S pressed!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Signature

<APIDocs functionName="useKeyPress" />

## Notes

- This hook does not rely on a `ReactFlowInstance` so you are free to use it
  anywhere in your app!
