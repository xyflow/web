# useNodeId()

You can use this hook to get the id of the node it is used inside. It is useful
if you need the node's id deeper in the render tree but don't want to manually
drill down the id as a prop.

```js
import { useNodeId } from '@xyflow/react';

export default function CustomNode() {
  return (
    <div>
      <span>This node has an id of </span>
      <NodeIdDisplay />
    </div>
  );
}

function NodeIdDisplay() {
  const nodeId = useNodeId();

  return <span>{nodeId}</span>;
}
```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />

## Notes

- This hook should only be used within a custom node or its children.
