# New ELKjs example

We added a new example for a more advanced usage of [ELKjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) to show how to use it with nodes with multiple handles. As you can see in the example, edge crossing is handled automatically by ELKjs and the nodes are ordered with help of the handle position. Check it out
[here](/examples/layout/elkjs-multiple-handles).
