A new version of React Flow is out. With 12.8.3 you get a lot of bug fixes and a great
improvement for handles. It's now possible to position child content of a handle outside
of the handle itself and still use it as a starting point for connections as you can see
in this example:

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/nodes/detached-handle"
  framework="react"
  showEditor={false}
/>
