  We want to know what pieces of the library and its ecosystem are most/least
  helpful to our users (and what is missing) as we slide into the new year. To
  help us work that out, we've put together a short survey.

# The first annual React Flow Developer Survey launches!

We've been doing this React Flow thing for a while now and between issues on
GitHub and conversations on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RVmnytFmGW),
we've learned a lot about what our users want and need from the library. It's a
lot harder to hear about people's experience with our docs or from the large number
of users that might not be actively taking part in our communities, though.

In the past we've arranged interviews with some of our Pro subscribers to get an
idea of how they use React Flow and the Pro Platform and found the insight
invaluable. This year we want to expand that to include as many of our users as
possible, so we've put together a short survey to help steer our direction going
into the new year.

It should only take a few minutes to complete and we'd really appreciate it if
you could find the time to fill it out. You can find the survey [here](https://reactflow.dev/developer-survey-2023)
and we'll be publishing the results early in the new year!
