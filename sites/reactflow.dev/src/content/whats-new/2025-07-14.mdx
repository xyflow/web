# We've updated our React Flow UI components!

We have made some significant improvements to [React Flow UI components](/components), 
including the BaseNode component.
These changes enhance the functionality, visual look and usability of the
components, making them more versatile for developers.

### Re-organization of Components Library

Some components have been moved to examples, while others have been consolidated in a new structure:

- **Nodes Utilities**: These components can be used as building blocks for creating custom nodes.
- **Custom Nodes**: These are fully functional nodes that can be used directly in your applications.
- **Handles**: These components are used to create connection points inside nodes.
- **Custom Edges**: Fully functional edges that can be used directly in your applications.
- **Controls**: Used to create interactive controls for nodes and edges.
- **Miscellaneous**: Various utility components that don't fit into the other categories, like [`DevTools`](/ui/components/devtools).

### BaseNode Enhancements

Our BaseNode component has been fully revamped, to provide an experience more
consistent with [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and the rest of our [React
Flow UI component library](/ui). 

The new BaseNode component now includes improved styling and wrapper components, aligning to shadcn UI design principles.

Just like a [shadcn UI Card component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card), the BaseNode component now has
- `BaseNodeHeader` and `BaseNodeHeaderTitle` for the header section,
- `BaseNodeContent` for the main content area
- `BaseNodeFooter` for the footer section.

This structure allows for better organization of content within the node, making it easier to create complex node layouts.

### Improved Examples and Nodes

We have also added a few new components and improved existing ones.
Our component pages now include more comprehensive examples that showcase the
new features and capabilities of the components. For example:

- New [`NodeAppendix`](/ui/components/node-appendix) component, which can be used to add additional information or controls to nodes, like a [`Node Badge`](/ui/components/node-appendix#example-badge)!
- The `AnnotationNode` component has been moved to an [example usage of
BaseNode](/ui/components/base-node#example-annotation-node),
to demonstrate how to style the BaseNode component effectively.
- The [`StatusIndicator`](/ui/components/status-indicator) now includes a variant with an overlaying spinner, and improved usage examples.
- The `TooltipNode` component, has been improved and moved to [`NodeTooltip`](/ui/components/node-tooltip). It is no longer a custom node, but rather an utility component that you can use to wrap your custom nodes with a tooltip.

### Removal of `selected` prop from `BaseNode` and related components. 

You do not now need to pass the `selected` prop to the BaseNode component or its related components anymore.
Styling for selected nodes is now handled automatically by tailwind CSS selectors.

However, `selected` is still a valid prop for nodes in React Flow, and you can still use it to determine if a node is selected or not
in your custom components.
If you do not need the `selected` prop for custom logic, but you only use it for styling, you can safely remove it from your components,
and you can follow how `BaseNode` is implemented to achieve custom styling for your custom selected nodes.

```tsx
export const BaseNode = forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "relative rounded-md border bg-card text-card-foreground",
      "hover:ring-1",
      // React Flow displays node elements inside of a `NodeWrapper` component,
      // which compiles down to a div with the class `react-flow__node`.
      // When a node is selected, the class `selected` is added to the
      // `react-flow__node` element. This allows us to style the node when it
      // is selected, using Tailwind's `&` selector.
      "[.react-flow\\_\\_node.selected_&]:border-muted-foreground",
      "[.react-flow\\_\\_node.selected_&]:shadow-lg",
      className,
    )}
    tabIndex={0}
    {...props}
  />
));
BaseNode.displayName = "BaseNode";
```
