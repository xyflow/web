import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared/server';

We’ve revamped the styles across all our React Flow examples. 
Plus, we added a new theme file to show you how to customize the style and 
interactions of your flows.

We think it looks fantastic and can’t wait to hear your feedback. 
Check out our updated Feature Overview below, along with all of our other 
updated [examples](/examples).
