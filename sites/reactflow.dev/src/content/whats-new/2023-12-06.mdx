title: React Flow Pro Platform goes open source!
description:
  We're excited to announce that we just open sourced our Pro Platform! The Pro
  Platform is where React Flow Pro subscribers can access and view “Pro Examples,”
  manage their subscription, and give team members access to the platform. We hope
  that some folks take a look and get inspired for their own projects.

# React Flow Pro Platform goes open source!

We fund our open source libraries with [React Flow Pro](https://reactflow.dev/pro)
subscriptions. Subscribers get access to our Pro Platform where they can view
advanced examples, contact us for 1:1 support, and help us prioritize GitHub
issues. So far that code has been private but we've rebuilt it from the ground-up,
added features, refreshed the design, and gave it the MIT License it deserves.

It's not plug-and-play at the moment, but we hope that some folks take a look,
get inspired for their own projects, and that our Pro Subscribers like the new
features we built.
