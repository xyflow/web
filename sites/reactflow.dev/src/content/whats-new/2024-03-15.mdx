React Flow 12 is finally here <Emoji content="✨" /> We are super excited and hope you
enjoy the new features as much as we do. The big topics for version 12 are:

1. **Support for SSG/ SSR**: you can now render flows on the server
2. **Computing flows**: new hooks and helper functions to simplify data flows
3. **Dark mode**: a new base style and easy way to switch between built in color modes
4. **Better DX with TSDoc**: we added TSDoc to improve the developer experience

If you want to **migrate from 11 to 12** or check out the **new features**, please refer
to the [migration guide](/learn/troubleshooting/migrate-to-v12).
