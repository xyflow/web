We refreshed the React Flow docs in November 2023, so things might look a little
different around here:

- **Docs are now called [Learn](/learn)**. This section aims to answer the question
  of "how do I use X?"

- **API is now called [Reference](/api-reference)**. This section answers the
  question "what is this thing?" A big change from the previous version of our
  docs are that all of our types, components, hooks, and util functions now get
  their own page now.

- "How to" blog posts now live in **Learn > [Tutorials](/learn/tutorials)**

## Why the changes?

So far the docs have been growing organically since 2019, without any sort of
overarching concept. While we worked on a website redesign, we decided it was time
to rethink how folks are using our docs so that we can create a better developer
experience. Our hope is that these changes make the docs easier to use for both
experienced React Flow users and newcomers.

We also did a change of tech stack along the way. We were using Docusaurus, and
now we're using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/). Cool beans.

If you find anything to change or improve, just click on the "Edit this page"
link on the right-side of any page in our docs or open an issue over on
[GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/web/issues/new/choose).
