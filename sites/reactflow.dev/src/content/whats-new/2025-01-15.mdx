# Whats New in React Flow 12.4.0

New year, new minor release :) This release contains mostly fixes but also introduces a new [`useNodeConnections`](/api-reference/hooks/use-node-connections) that is the successor of `useHandleConnections`.

### Minor Changes

- [#4725](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/4725) Add `useNodeConnections` hook to track all connections to a node. Can be filtered by handleType and handleId.

### Patch Changes

- [#4947](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/4947) Export ResizeControlVariant correctly as a value.
- [#4880](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/4880) Thanks [@crimx](https://github.com/crimx)! - Add type check for all event targets
- [#4929](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/4929) Optimize selections and take into account if edges connected to selected nodes are actually selectable.
