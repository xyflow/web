# New release 11.10.0!

We want to make the migration for v12 as smooth as possible. That's why we added deprecation warnings for the following util functions:

#### Rename `useReactFlow.project` to `useReactFlow.screenToFlowPosition`

‚ö†Ô∏è **changes**: no need to subtract react flow bounds anymore!

before:

```js
const reactFlowBounds = reactFlowWrapper.current.getBoundingClientRect();

const position = reactFlowInstance.project({
  x: event.clientX - reactFlowBounds.left,
  y: event.clientY - reactFlowBounds.top,
});
```

after:

```js
const position = reactFlowInstance.screenToFlowPosition({
  x: event.clientX,
  y: event.clientY,
});
```

#### Rename `getTransformForBounds` to `getViewportForBounds`

‚ö†Ô∏è **changes**: returns `{ x: number, y: number, zoom: number }` instead of `[number, number, number]`.

before:

```js
const [x, y, zoom] = getTransformForBounds(bounds, width, height, 0.5, 2);
```

after:

```js
const { x, y, zoom } = getViewportForBounds(bounds, width, height, 0.5, 2);
```

#### Rename `getRectOfNodes` to `getNodesBounds`

no changes, just a renaming.

### New features

- added `useReactFlow.flowToScreenPosition` for completion

Besides that we fixed some bugs üêõ You can find all change in the [v11.10.0 Github release](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/releases/tag/11.10.0).
