description: We released React Flow v11.10.0 with deprecations and some bugfixes.

We want to make the migration for v12 as smooth as possible. That's why we added deprecation warnings for the following util functions:

#### Rename `useReactFlow.project` to `useReactFlow.screenToFlowPosition`

⚠️ **changes**: no need to subtract react flow bounds anymore!

before:

```js
const reactFlowBounds = reactFlowWrapper.current.getBoundingClientRect();

const position = reactFlowInstance.project({
  x: event.clientX - reactFlowBounds.left,
  y: event.clientY - reactFlowBounds.top,
});
```

after:

```js
const position = reactFlowInstance.screenToFlowPosition({
  x: event.clientX,
  y: event.clientY,
});
```

#### Rename `getTransformForBounds` to `getViewportForBounds`

⚠️ **changes**: returns `{ x: number, y: number, zoom: number }` instead of `[number, number, number]`.

before:

```js
const [x, y, zoom] = getTransformForBounds(bounds, width, height, 0.5, 2);
```

after:

```js
const { x, y, zoom } = getViewportForBounds(bounds, width, height, 0.5, 2);
```

#### Rename `getRectOfNodes` to `getNodesBounds`

no changes, just a renaming.

### New features

- added `useReactFlow.flowToScreenPosition` for completion

Besides that we fixed some bugs 🐛 You can find all change in the [v11.10.0 Github release](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/releases/tag/11.10.0).
