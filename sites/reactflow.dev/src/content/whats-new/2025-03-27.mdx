### `fitView` just got a lot better!

Have ever struggled with making `fitView` work right after adding or changing your nodes? Does your code look something like this?

```ts
setNodes((nodes) => [nodes, ...newNode]);
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  fitView();
});
// renders the node first and then fits the view :(
```

Well, you are in for a treat! No more hacks, no more `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` and no more split second frames of unfitted views!

```ts
setNodes((nodes) => [nodes, ...newNode]);
fitView(); // it just works.
// adding a new node and fitting the view happens at the same time
```

#### One more thing

You might have realized that the `padding` value for `fitViewOptions` is quite a weird fella! What does `padding: 0.3` even mean? Well we don't know either, so you you can now pass pixel values `'25px'`, viewport percentages `'10%'` and true pros can now even

```ts
const fitViewOptions = {
  padding: {
    /** horizontal */
    x: '100px',
    /** vertical */
    y: '50px',
    /** e.g. top overwrites x */
    top: '25px',
    /** mix and match units */
    left: '15%',
    /** legacy units still work */
    bottom: 0.1,
    /** have a modal on the right that stretches 50% over the screen? */
    right: '50%',
  },
};
```

```ts
setNodes((nodes) => [nodes, ...newNode]);
fitView(); // it just works.
// adding a new node and fitting the view happens at the same time
```
