Our [React Flow UI](/ui) components have been updated to support the latest version of
shadcn/ui, on React 19 and Tailwind 4!

This update includes a fresh look from the latest version of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and a new [UI Components tutorial](/learn/tutorials/getting-started-with-react-flow-components) to get you started.

### How to upgrade your project

To upgrade your project, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Update dependencies.

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest tailwindcss@latest
```

Or do so manually in package.json, and then run

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install
```

### Step 2: Run the Tailwind CSS upgrade codemod.

Read more about available codemods in the
[shadcn/ui Tailwind CSS 4 upgrade guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4).

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

### Step 3: Move the React Flow styles to the `global.css` file.

**Important:** Tailwind CSS 4 is now configured completely in CSS. Instead of importing
your `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css` file in your `App.tsx`, you will need to it in your
`global.css` file, after you import `tailwindcss`.

```diff filename="global.css"
// Tailwind CSS 3
-@tailwind base;
-@tailwind components;
-@tailwind utilities;

// Tailwind CSS 4
+@import "tailwindcss";
+@import "tw-animate-css";
+@layer base {
+  @import "@xyflow/react/dist/style.css";
+}
```

We recommend removing the old `js`/`ts` tailwind configuration from your project, and migrating to the new CSS-variable-only configuration.
This can make things a lot simpler: you can configure everything related to your application's design system and look in a single CSS file.

```diff filename="App.tsx"
-import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';
import "./globals.css";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Update the components

For each component you want to update, you can run the following commands.

If it's a shadcn/ui component:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add component-name
```

If it's a React Flow UI component:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name
```
