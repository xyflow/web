# We finally made an editable edge Pro example

One of the most common questions we get from users is how to let users edit an
edge's path. This Pro example demonstrates how to do exactly that, by cutting
up an edge into segments that can be freely moved around.

We hope folks will find this example and use the same technique to implement
features like freeform edge drawing or algorithmic edge routing.
