  React Flow doesn't include any layouting algorithms out of the box. This guide surveys
  some of the options out there and shows you how to use them with React Flow.

# Overview

We regularly get asked how to handle layouting in React Flow. We have not implemented our
own layouting solution yet, but will present some viable external libraries on this page.
We'll split things up into resources for layouting nodes and resources for routing edges.

You can test out some of the layouting options in our
[playground](https://play.reactflow.dev/) or have a look at the
[examples](/examples#layout) we've put together.

To start let's put together a simple example flow that we can use as a base for testing
out the different layouting options.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/layouting-flow-1-empty" framework="react" />

Each of the examples that follow will be built on this empty flow. Where possible we've
tried to keep the examples confined to just one `index.js` file so it's easy for you to
compare how they're set up.

## Layouting nodes

For layouting nodes, there are a few third-party libraries that we think are worth
checking out:

| Library                                            | Dynamic node sizes | Sub-flow layouting | Edge routing | Bundle size                                                                                                                                   |

¹ Dagre currently has an [open issue](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/issues/238) that
prevents it from laying out sub-flows correctly if any nodes in the sub-flow are connected
to nodes outside the sub-flow.

We've loosely ordered these options from simplest to most complex, where dagre is largely
a drop-in solution and elkjs is a full-blown highly configurable layouting engine. Below,
we'll take a look at a brief example of how each of these libraries can be used with React
Flow. For dagre and elkjs specifically, we have some separate examples you can refer back
to [here](/examples/layout/dagre) and [here](/examples/layout/elkjs).

### Dagre

- Repo: https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre
- Docs: https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki#configuring-the-layout

Dagre is a simple library for layouting directed graphs. It has minimal configuration
options and a focus on speed over choosing the most optimal layout. If you need to
organize your flows into a tree, _we highly recommend dagre_.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/layouting-flow-2-dagre" framework="react" />

With no effort at all we get a well-organized tree layout! Whenever `getLayoutedElements`
is called, we'll reset the dagre graph and set the graph's direction (either left-to-right
or top-to-bottom) based on the `direction` prop. Dagre needs to know the dimensions of
each node in order to lay them out, so we iterate over our list of nodes and add them to
dagre's internal graph.

After laying out the graph, we'll return an object with the layouted nodes and edges. We
do this by mapping over the original list of nodes and updating each node's position
according to node stored in the dagre graph.

Documentation for dagre's configuration options can be found
[here](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki#configuring-the-layout), including properties
to set for spacing and alignment.

### D3-Hierarchy

- Repo: https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy
- Docs: https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy

When you know your graph is a tree with a single root node, d3-hierarchy can provide a
handful of interesting layouting options. While the library can layout a simple tree just
fine, it also has layouting algorithms for tree maps, partition layouts, and enclosure
diagrams.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/layouting-flow-3-d3-hierarchy" framework="react" />

<Callout>
  D3-hierarchy expects your graphs to have a single root node, so it won't work in all
  cases. It's also important to note that d3-hierarchy assigns the same width and height
  to _all_ nodes when calculating the layout, so it's not the best choice if you're
  displaying lots of different node types.
</Callout>

### D3-Force

- Repo: https://github.com/d3/d3-force
- Docs: https://d3js.org/d3-force

For something more interesting than a tree, a force-directed layout might be the way to
go. D3-Force is a physics-based layouting library that can be used to position nodes by
applying different forces to them.

As a consequence, it's a little more complicated to configure and use compared to dagre
and d3-hierarchy. Importantly, d3-force's layouting algorithm is iterative, so we need a
way to keep computing the layout across multiple renders.

First, let's see what it does:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/layouting-flow-4-d3-force" framework="react" />

We've changed our `getLayoutedElements` to a hook called `useLayoutedElements` instead.
Additionally, instead of passing in the nodes and edges explicitly, we'll use get
`getNodes` and `getEdges` functions from the `useReactFlow` hook. This is important when
combined with the store selector in `initialized` because it will prevent us from
reconfiguring the simulation any time the nodes update.

The simulation is configured with a number of different forces applied so you can see how
they interact: play around in your own code to see how you want to configure those forces.
You can find the documentation and some different examples of d3-force
[here](https://d3js.org/d3-force).

<Callout>
  <strong>Rectangular collisions</strong>
  D3-Force has a built-in collision force, but it assumes nodes are circles. We've thrown
  together a custom force in `collision.js` that uses a similar algorithm but accounts for
  our rectangular nodes instead. Feel free to steal it or let us know if you have any
  suggestions for improvements!
</Callout>

The tick function progresses the simulation by one step and then updates React Flow with
the new node positions. We've also included a demonstration on how to handle node dragging
while the simulation is running: if your flow isn't interactive you can ignore that part!

<Callout>
  For larger graphs, computing the force layout every render forever is going to incur a
  big performance hit. In this example we have a simple toggle to turn the layouting on
  and off, but you might want to come up with some other approach to only compute the
  layout when necessary.
</Callout>

### Elkjs

- Repo: https://github.com/kieler/elkjs
- Docs: https://eclipse.dev/elk/reference.html (good luck!)

Elkjs is certainly the most configurable option available, but it's also the most
complicated. Elkjs is a Java library that's been ported to JavaScript, and it provides a
huge number of options for configuring the layout of your graph.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/layouting-flow-6-elkjs" framework="react" />

At it's most basic we can compute layouts similar to dagre, but because the layouting
algorithm runs asynchronously we need to create a `useLayoutedElements` hook similar to
the one we created for d3-force.

<Callout>
  <strong>The ELK reference is your new best friend</strong>
  We don't often recommend elkjs because it's complexity makes it difficult for us to
  support folks when they need it. If you do decide to use it, you'll want to keep the
  original [Java API reference](https://eclipse.dev/elk/reference.html) handy.
</Callout>

We've also included a few examples of some of the other layouting algorithms available,
including a non-interactive force layout.

### Honourable Mentions

Of course, we can't go through every layouting library out there: we'd never work on
anything else! Here are some other libraries we've come across that might be worth taking
a look at:

- If you want to use dagre or d3-hierarchy but need to support nodes with different
  dimensions, both [d3-flextree](https://github.com/klortho/d3-flextree) and
  [entitree-flex](https://github.com/codeledge/entitree-flex) look promising.

  You can find an example of how to use entitree-flex with React Flow
  [here](/examples/layout/entitree-flex).

- [Cola.js](https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola) looks like a promising option for
  so-called "constraint-based" layouts. We haven't had time to properly investigate it
  yet, but it looks like you can achieve results similar to d3-force but with a lot more
  control.

## Routing Edges

If you don't have any requirements for edge routing, you can use one of the layouting
libraries above to position nodes and let the edges fall wherever they may. Otherwise,
you'll want to look into some libraries and techniques for edge routing.

Your options here are more limited than for node layouting, but here are some resources we
thought looked promising:

- [react-flow-smart-edge](https://github.com/tisoap/react-flow-smart-edge)
- [Routing Orthogonal Diagram Connectors in JavaScript](https://medium.com/swlh/routing-orthogonal-diagram-connectors-in-javascript-191dc2c5ff70)

If you do explore some custom edge routing options, consider contributing back to the
community by writing a blog post or creating a library!

Our [editable edge Pro Example](/examples/edges/editable-edge) could also be used as a
starting point for implementing a custom edge that can be routed along a specific path.
