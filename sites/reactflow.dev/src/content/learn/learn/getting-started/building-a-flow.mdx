# Building a Flow

In this section, we’ll introduce you to the basics of React Flow and guide you through creating your first flow.

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating an empty flow with a controls panel and a background. First, we need to import some basic components from the `@xyflow/react` package:

```js
import { ReactFlow, Background, Controls } from '@xyflow/react';
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';
```

We can now use these components to render an empty flow. There are three important things to keep in mind here:

1. Don't forget to **import the stylesheet**. Otherwise, React Flow won't work.

2. The **parent container needs a width and a height** because React Flow uses its parent dimensions.

3. If you have **multiple flows on one page**, you need to pass a unique `id` prop to each component to make React Flow work properly.

## Adding Nodes

Now that the flow is set up, it's time to add nodes—each node represents an element in your diagram with a specific position and content. Create an array of [node objects](/api-reference/types/node) like this:

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1', // required
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // required
    data: { label: 'Hello' }, // required
  },
];
```

Then we can add our first node to the flow like this:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-2" framework="react" />

Let's add another node, and apply the node type `input` to the first node. React Flow uses different node types to indicate their roles. An **input node**—designated by the type `input`—typically serves as the entry point to your flow.

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: { label: 'Hello' },
    type: 'input',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    data: { label: 'World' },
  },
];
```

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-3" framework="react" />

There are many ways to configure nodes in React Flow. We have several built-in options that you can explore in the [node](/api-reference/types/node) documentation. However, when it comes to customizing nodes, the possibilities are endless. For more details, check out our guide on [customizing nodes](/api-reference/types/node).

## Adding an Edge

Now that we have two nodes, let's connect them with an edge.

To create an edge, we define a unique edge id and specify two attributes: the source (where the edge begins) and the target (where it ends). In this example, we use the `id` values of the two nodes we created so far—"1" and "2"—to define the edge:

```js
const edges = [{ id: '1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];
```

This edge connects the node with `id` "1" (the source) to the node with `id` "2" (the target).

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-4" framework="react" />

Let's give this edge two properties that are built into React Flow, a `label` and a "step" `type`.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-5" framework="react" />

You made your first edge, nice work! You might have realized that you can't drag or select nodes. In the next part you'll learn how to make the flow interactive.
