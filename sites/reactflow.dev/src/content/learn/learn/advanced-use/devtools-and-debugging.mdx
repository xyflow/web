# Devtools and Debugging

<Callout type="info">
  This is an ongoing experiment on implementing our own React Flow devtools.
  While we are working on the actual package, we'd love to hear about your
  feedback and ideas on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Bqt6xrs) or via mail at
  info@xyflow.com.
</Callout>

React Flow can often seem like a magic black box, but in reality you can reveal
quite a lot about its internal state if you know where to look. In this guide we
will show you three different ways to reveal the internal state of your flow:

- A `<ViewportLogger />` component that shows the current position and zoom level
  of the viewport.
- A `<NodeInspector />` component that reveals the state of each node.
- A `<ChangeLogger />` that wraps your flow's `onNodesChange` handler and logs
  each change as it is dispatched.

While we find these tools useful for making sure React Flow is working properly,
you might also find them useful for debugging your applications as your flows and
their interactions become more complex.

<div className="nestedSandpack">
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="learn/devtools"
    framework="react"
    orientation="vertical"
    editorHeight="50vh"
  />
</div>

We encourage you to copy any or all of the components from this example into your
own projects and modify them to suit your needs: each component works independently!

## Node Inspector

The `<NodeInspector />` component makes use of our [`useNodes`](/api-reference/hooks/use-nodes)
hook to access all the nodes in the flow. Typically we discourage using this hook
because it will trigger a re-render any time _any_ of your nodes change, but that's
exactly what makes it so useful for debugging!

The `width` and `height` properties are added to each node by React Flow after it has measured
the node's dimensions. We pass those dimensions, as well as other information like
the node's id and type, to a custom `<NodeInfo />` component.

We make use of the [`<ViewportPortal />`](/api-reference/components/viewport-portal)
component to let us render the inspector into React Flow's viewport. That means
it's content will be positioned and transformed along with the rest of the flow
as the user pans and zooms.

## Change Logger

Any change to your nodes and edges that originates from React Flow itself is
communicated to you through the `onNodesChange` and `onEdgesChange` callbacks.
If you are working with a controlled flow (that means you're managing the nodes
and edges yourself), you need to apply those changes to your state in order to
keep everything in sync.

The `<ChangeLogger />` component wraps your user-provided `onNodesChange` handler
with a custom function that intercepts and logs each change as it is dispatched.
We can do this by using the [`useStore`](/api-reference/hooks/use-store) and
[`useStoreApi`](/api-reference/hooks/use-store-api) hooks to access the store and
and then update React Flow's internal state accordingly. These two hooks give you
powerful access to React Flow's internal state and methods.

Beyond debugging, using the `<ChangeLogger />` can be a great way to learn more
about how React Flow works and get you thinking about the different functionality
you can build on top of each change.

You can find documentation on the [`NodeChange`](/api-reference/types/node-change)
and [`EdgeChange`](/api-reference/types/edge-change) types in the API reference.

## Viewport Logger

The `<ViewportLogger />` is the simplest example of what state you can pull out
of React Flow's store if you know what to look for. The state of the viewport is
stored internally under the `transform` key (a name we inherited from
[d3-zoom](https://d3js.org/d3-zoom#zoomTransform)). This component extracts the
`x`, `y`, and `zoom` components of the transform and renders them into a
[`<Panel />`](/api-reference/components/panel) component.

## Let us know what you think

As mentioned above, if you have any feedback or ideas on how to improve the devtools,
please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Bqt6xrs) or via mail at
info@xyflow.com. If you build your own devtools using these ideas, we'd love to
hear about it!
