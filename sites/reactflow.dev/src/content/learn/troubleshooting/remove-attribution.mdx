# Remove Attribution

This example demonstrates how you can remove the React Flow attribution from the renderer.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';
import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';

import { getStaticCode } from 'xy-shared/server';
export const getStaticProps = getStaticCode(['learn/remove-attribution']);


<Callout type="info">
If you’re considering removing the attribution, we’d first like to mention:

**If you’re using React Flow at your organization and making money from it**, we rely on your support to keep React Flow developed and maintained under an MIT License. Before you remove the attribution, [see the ways you can support React Flow to keep it running](https://reactflow.dev/pro).

**Are you using React Flow for a personal project?** Great! Go ahead and remove the attribution. You can support us by reporting any bugs you find, sending us screenshots of your projects, and starring us on [Github](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow). If you start making money using React Flow or use it in an organization in the future, we would ask that you re-add the attribution or sign up for one of our subscriptions.

Thank you for supporting us ✌🏻
