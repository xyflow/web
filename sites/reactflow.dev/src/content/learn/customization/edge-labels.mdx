# Edge Labels

One of the more common uses for [custom edges](/learn/customization/custom-edges) is rendering some controls or info
along an edge's path. In React Flow we call that an _edge label_ and unlike the
edge path, edge labels can be any React component!

## Adding an edge label

To render a custom edge label we must wrap it in the
[`<EdgeLabelRenderer />`](/api-reference/components/edge-label-renderer) component.
This allows us to render the labels outside of the SVG world where the edges life.
The edge label renderer is a portal to a single container that _all_ edge labels are rendered into.

Let's add a button to our custom edge that can be used to delete the edge it's
attached to:

```jsx
import {
  BaseEdge,
  EdgeLabelRenderer,
  getStraightPath,
  useReactFlow,
} from '@xyflow/react';

export default function CustomEdge({ id, sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY }) {
  const { deleteElements } = useReactFlow();
  const [edgePath] = getStraightPath({
    sourceX,
    sourceY,
    targetX,
    targetY,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <BaseEdge id={id} path={edgePath} />
      <EdgeLabelRenderer>
        <button onClick={() => deleteElements({ edges: [{ id }] })}>delete</button>
      </EdgeLabelRenderer>
    </>
  );
}
```

If we try to use this edge now, we'll see that the button is rendered in the
centre of the flow (it might be hidden behind "Node A"). Because of the edge
label portal, we'll need to do some extra work to position the button ourselves.

  alt="A screen shot of a simple flow. The edge label renderer is highlighted in
  the DOM inspector and the button is rendered in the centre of the flow."
/>

Fortunately, the path utils we've already seen can help us with this! Along with
the SVG path to render, these functions also return the `x` and `y` coordinates
of the path's midpoint. We can then use these coordinates to translate our custom
edge label's into the right position!

```jsx
export default function CustomEdge({ id, sourceX, sourceY, targetX, targetY }) {
  const { deleteElements } = useReactFlow();
  const [edgePath, labelX, labelY] = getStraightPath({ ... });

  return (
    ...
        <button
          style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            transform: `translate(-50%, -50%) translate(${labelX}px, ${labelY}px)`,
            pointerEvents: 'all',
          }}
          className="nodrag nopan"
          onClick={() => {
            onClick={() => deleteElements({ edges: [{ id }] })}
          }}
        >
    ...
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  To make sure our edge labels are interactive and not just for presentation, it
  is important to add `pointer-events: all` to the label's style. This will ensure
  that the label is clickable.

And just like with interactive controls in custom nodes, we need to remember
to add the `nodrag` and `nopan` classes to the label to stop mouse events from
controlling the canvas.

</Callout>

Here's an interactive example with our updated custom edge. Clicking the delete
button will remove that edge from the flow. Creating a new edge will use the
custom node.
