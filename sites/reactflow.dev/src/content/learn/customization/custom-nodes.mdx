# Custom Nodes

A powerful feature of React Flow is the ability to create custom nodes. This gives you the flexibility to render anything you want within your nodes. We generally recommend creating your own custom nodes rather than relying on built-in ones. With custom nodes, you can add as many source and target handles as you like—or even embed form inputs, charts, and other interactive elements.

In this section, we'll walk through creating a custom node featuring an input field that updates text elsewhere in your application. For further examples, we recommend checking out our [Custom Node Example](/examples/nodes/custom-node).

## Implementing a Custom Node

To create a custom node, all you need to do is create a React component. React Flow will automatically wrap it in an interactive container that injects essential props like the node's id, position, and data, and provides functionality for selection, dragging, and connecting handles. For a full reference on all available custom node props, see the [Custom Node Props](/api-reference/types/node-props).

Let's dive into an example by creating a custom node called `TextUpdaterNode`. For this, we've added a simple input field with a change handler. React Flow has a few handy [pre-built components](/api-reference/components) to simplify the process of creating custom nodes. We will use the [`Handle` component](/api-reference/components/handle) to allow our custom node to connect with other nodes.

```jsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { Handle, Position } from '@xyflow/react';

const handleStyle = { left: 10 };

function TextUpdaterNode({ data }) {
  const onChange = useCallback((evt) => {
    console.log(evt.target.value);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <Handle type="target" position={Position.Top} />
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="text">Text:</label>
        <input id="text" name="text" onChange={onChange} className="nodrag" />
      </div>
      <Handle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} id="a" />
      <Handle type="source" position={Position.Bottom} id="b" style={handleStyle} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Adding the Node Type

You can add a new node type to React Flow by adding it to the `nodeTypes` prop like below. We define the `nodeTypes` outside of the component to prevent re-renderings.

```jsx
const nodeTypes = {
  textUpdater: TextUpdaterNode
};

function Flow() {
  ...
  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
      nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
      fitView
      style={rfStyle}
    />
  );
}
```

If **`nodeTypes` are defined inside a component, they must be memoized.** Otherwise, React creates a new object on every render, which leads to performance issues and bugs. Here's how you can memoize the `nodeTypes` object inside a component using the `useMemo` hook:

```jsx
const nodeTypes = useMemo(() => ({ textUpdater: TextUpdaterNode }), []);

return <ReactFlow nodeTypes={nodeTypes} />;
```

After defining your new node type, you can use it by using the `type` node option:

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: 'node-1',
    type: 'textUpdater',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: { value: 123 },
  },
];
```

After putting all together and adding some basic styles we get a custom node that prints text to the console:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/custom-node" framework="react" />

## Utility Classes

React Flow provides several built-in utility CSS classes to help you fine-tune how interactions work within your custom nodes.

### `nodrag`

In the example above, we added the class `nodrag` to the input. This ensures that interacting with the input field doesn't trigger a drag, allowing you to select the text within the field.

Nodes have a `drag` class name in place by default. However, this class name can affect the behaviour of the event listeners inside your custom nodes. To prevent unexpected behaviours, add a `nodrag` class name to elements with an event listener. This prevents the default drag behavior as well as the default node selection behavior when elements with this class are clicked.

```tsx
export default function CustomNode(props: NodeProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input className="nodrag" type="range" min={0} max={100} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `nowheel`

If your custom node contains scrollable content, you can apply the `nowheel` class. This disables the canvas' default pan behavior when you scroll inside your custom node, ensuring that only the content scrolls instead of moving the entire canvas.

```tsx
export default function CustomNode(props: NodeProps) {
  return (
    <div className="nowheel" style={{ overflow: 'auto' }}>
      <p>Scrollable content...</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Applying these utility classes helps you control interaction on a granular level. You can customize these class names inside React Flow's [style props](/api-reference/react-flow/#style-props).

<Callout type="info">
  When creating your own custom nodes, you will also need to remember to style them!
  Unlike the built-in nodes, custom nodes have no default styles, so feel free to use any
  styling method you prefer, such as [styled
  components](/examples/styling/styled-components) or [Tailwind
  CSS](/examples/styling/tailwind).

## Using Multiple Handles

When defining edge connections to other nodes using these handles, simply using the node `id` isn't enough. You will also need to specify a handle `id`. In this case, we assign an id `a` to one source handle and an id `b` to the other source handle.

In React Flow, edges can be connected to specific handles within a node using the properties `sourceHandle` (for the edge's starting point) and `targetHandle` (for the edge's ending point). When you have multiple handles on a node—for example, two source handles labeled "`a`" and "`b`", simply specifying the node's `id` isn't enough for React Flow to know which connection point to use. By defining `sourceHandle` or `targetHandle` with the appropriate handle `id`, you instruct React Flow to attach the edge to that specific handle, ensuring that connections are made where you intend.

```js
const initialEdges = [
  { id: 'edge-1', source: 'node-1', sourceHandle: 'a', target: 'node-2' },
  { id: 'edge-2', source: 'node-1', sourceHandle: 'b', target: 'node-3' },
];
```

In this case, the source node is `node-1` for both handles but the handle `id`s are different. One comes from handle id `"a"` and the other one from `"b"`. Both edges also have different target nodes:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/custom-node-2" framework="react" />

If you are programmatically changing the position or number of handles
in your custom node, you will need to use the
[`useUpdateNodeInternals`](/api-reference/hooks/use-update-node-internals) hook
to properly notify React Flow of changes.
