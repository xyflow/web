# Handles

Handles are the connection points on [nodes](/learn/concepts/terms-and-definitions#nodes) in React Flow. Our built-in nodes include one source and one target handle, but you can customize your nodes with as many different handles as you need.

## Creating a Node with Handles

To create a [custom node](/learn/customization/custom-nodes) with handles, you can use the [`<Handle />` component](/api-reference/components/handle) provided by React Flow. This component allows you to define source and target handles for your custom nodes. Here's an example of how to implement a custom node with two handles:

```jsx
import { Handle } from '@xyflow/react';

export function CustomNode() {
  return (
    <div className="custom-node">
      <div>Custom Node Content</div>
      <Handle type="source" position="top" />
      <Handle type="target" position="bottom" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Using Multiple Handles

If you want to use multiple source or target handles in your custom node, you need to specify each handle with a unique `id`. This allows React Flow to differentiate between the handles when connecting edges.

```jsx
  <Handle type="target" position="top" />
  <Handle type="source" position="right" id="a" />
  <Handle type="source" position="bottom" id="b" />
```

To connect an edge to a specific handle of a node, use the properties `sourceHandle` (for the edge's starting point) and `targetHandle` (for the edge's ending point). By defining `sourceHandle` or `targetHandle` with the appropriate handle `id`, you instruct React Flow to attach the edge to that specific handle, ensuring that connections are made where you intend.

```js
const initialEdges = [
  { id: 'edge-1', source: 'node-1', sourceHandle: 'a', target: 'node-2' },
  { id: 'edge-2', source: 'node-1', sourceHandle: 'b', target: 'node-3' },
];
```

In this case, the source node is `node-1` for both handles but the handle `id`s are different. One comes from handle id `a` and the other one from `b`. Both edges also have different target nodes:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/custom-node-2" framework="react" />

If you are programmatically changing the position or number of handles
in your custom node, you will need to use the
[`useUpdateNodeInternals`](/api-reference/hooks/use-update-node-internals) hook
to properly notify React Flow of changes.

## Custom handles

You can create your own custom handles by wrapping the `<Handle />` component.
This example shows a custom handle that only allows connections when the
connection source matches a given id.

```jsx
import { Handle, Position } from '@xyflow/react';

export const TargetHandleWithValidation = ({ position, source }) => (
  <Handle
    type="target"
    position={position}
    isValidConnection={(connection) => connection.source === source}
    onConnect={(params) => console.log('handle onConnect', params)}
    style={{ background: '#fff' }}
  />
);
```

## Dynamic handles

If you are programmatically changing the position or number of handles in your
custom node, you need to update the node internals with the
[`useUpdateNodeInternals`](/api-reference/hooks/use-update-node-internals) hook.

You can find an example of how to implement a custom node with multiple handles
in the [custom node guide](/learn/customization/custom-nodes) or in the
[custom node example](/examples/nodes/custom-node).

## Custom handle styles

Since the handle is a div, you can use CSS to style it or pass a style prop to
customize a Handle. You can see this in the
[Add Node On Edge Drop](/examples/nodes/add-node-on-edge-drop) and
[Simple Floating Edges](/examples/edges/simple-floating-edges) examples.

### Styling handles when connecting

The handle receives the additional class names `connecting` when the connection
line is above the handle and `valid` if the connection is valid. You can find an
example which uses these classes [here](/examples/interaction/validation).

### Hiding Handles

- If you need to hide a handle for some reason, you must use `visibility: hidden`
  or `opacity: 0` instead of `display: none`. This is important because React
  Flow needs to calculate the dimensions of the handle to work properly and using
  `display: none` will report a width and height of `0`!
