# Adding Interactivity

Now that we've built our first flow, let's add interactivity so you can select, drag, and remove nodes and edges.

<Callout type="info">
  In this Getting Started tutorial, we'll use React Flow as a ["controlled
  component"](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). This is
  typically the most flexible and reliable approach for integrating it into your
  applications. (If you prefer, you can also work with React Flow in an [uncontrolled
  way](/docs/guides/uncontrolled-flow/).
</Callout>

## Handling Change Events

Continuing from [Building a Flow]('/learn/getting-started/building-a-flow), letâ€™s dive into some essentials. To manage changes, we'll be using `useState` with two helper functions from React Flow: `applyEdgeChanges` and `applyNodeChanges`. We can import these into our project like this:

```js
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { ReactFlow, applyEdgeChanges, applyNodeChanges } from '@xyflow/react';
```

Next, we're going to set up states for both the nodes and edges:

```js
const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(initialNodes);
const [edges, setEdges] = useState(initialEdges);
```

Directly beneath that, we'll add these two functions:

```js
const onNodesChange = useCallback(
  (changes) => setNodes((nds) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nds)),
  [],
);
const onEdgesChange = useCallback(
  (changes) => setEdges((eds) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, eds)),
  [],
);
```

When you drag or select a node, the `onNodesChange` handler is triggered. The `applyNodeChanges` function then uses these change events to update the current state of your nodes. Here's how it all comes together. Try clicking and dragging a node to move it around and watch the UI update in real time.

## Handle Connections

One last piece is missing: connecting nodes manually. For this, we need to implement an `onConnect` handler and pass it to the `<ReactFlow />` component:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/make-it-interactive-2" framework="react" />

Try to connect the two nodes by dragging from on handle to another one. That's it. You've built a fully interactive flow.

That's it for now :) You made it! If you want to move on, we recommend to check out the ["Custom Nodes" guide](/learn/customization/custom-nodes).
