# Building a Flow

In this section, we’ll introduce you to the basics of React Flow and guide you through creating your first flow. We assume you have Node.js installed, along with a package manager such as npm, yarn, or pnpm. The React Flow package is published on npm under `@xyflow/react` and can be installed with:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash copy
npm install @xyflow/react
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```bash copy
pnpm add @xyflow/react
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>

```bash copy
yarn add @xyflow/react
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```bash copy
bun add @xyflow/react
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating an empty flow with a controls panel and a background. First, we need to import some basic components from the `@xyflow/react` package:

```js
import { ReactFlow, Background, Controls } from '@xyflow/react';
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';
```

We can now use these components to render an empty flow. There are three important things to keep in mind here:

1. Don't forget to **import the stylesheet**. Otherwise, React Flow won't work.

2. The **parent container needs a width and a height** because React Flow uses its parent dimensions.

3. If you have **multiple flows on one page**, you need to pass a unique `id` prop to each component to make React Flow work properly.

## Adding Nodes

Now that the flow is set up, it's time to add nodes—each node represents an element in your diagram with a specific position and content. Create an array of [node objects](/api-reference/types/node) like this:

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1', // required
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // required
    data: { label: 'Hello' }, // required
  },
];
```

Then we can add our first node to the flow like this:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-2" framework="react" />

Let's add another node, and apply the node type `input` to the first node. React Flow uses different node types to indicate their roles. An **input node**—designated by the type `input`—typically serves as the entry point to your flow.

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: { label: 'Hello' },
    type: 'input',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    data: { label: 'World' },
  },
];
```

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-3" framework="react" />

There are many ways to configure nodes. For example, you might use different types or add custom data based on your application's needs. You can see the full list of node options on the [node option site](/api-reference/types/node).

This setup attaches the nodes to your flow, paving the way for further customizations, like adding edges to connect them.

## Adding an Edge

Now that we have two nodes, let's connect them with an edge.

To make an edge, we need to specify two attributes: the source node (where the edge begins) and the target node (where the edge ends). We use the `id` of the two nodes to specify this (in our example, our two nodes have ids of "1" and "2"):

```js
const edges = [{ id: '1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];
```

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-4" framework="react" />

Let's give this edge two properties that are built into React Flow, a `label` and a different `type`.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/getting-started-5" framework="react" />

You made your first edge, nice work! You might have realized that you can't drag or select nodes. In the next part you'll learn how to make the flow interactive.
