# Key Features

### <Emoji content="👌" /> Easy to use

React Flow comes with many of the features you want out of the box. Dragging
nodes around, zooming and panning, selecting multiple nodes and edges, and
adding/removing edges are all built-in.

### <Emoji content="🎨" /> Customizable

React Flow supports custom node types and edge types. Because custom nodes are just
React components, you can implement anything you need: you're not locked into
the built-in node types. Custom edges let you add labels, controls, and bespoke
logic to node edges.

### <Emoji content="⚡️" /> Fast rendering

React Flow only renders nodes that have changed, and makes sure only those that
are in the viewport are displayed at all.

### <Emoji content="🧩" /> Built-in plugins

We ship React Flow with a few plugins out of the box like a mini map, graph controls, and a node toolbar.

### <Emoji content="💪" /> Reliable

React Flow is entirely written in TypeScript to catch bugs early and make fixes
easy. For everything else, we have a robust cypress test suite so you can depend
on React Flow with confidence.
