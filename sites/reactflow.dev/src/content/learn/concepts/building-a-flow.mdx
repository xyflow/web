# Building a Flow

In the following pages we will introduce you to the core concepts of React Flow
and explain how to create a basic interactive flow.
A flow consists of [nodes](/api-reference/types/node), [edges](/api-reference/types/edge) and the viewport.

To follow along with this guide you will need to have a React project set up and install the `@xyflow/react` package:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @xyflow/react
```

## Creating the flow

Let's start by creating an empty flow with viewport [`<Controls />`](/api-reference/components/controls)
and a dotted [`<Background />`](/api-reference/components/background).

<Steps>
### Add imports
First, we need to import some basic components from the `@xyflow/react` package 
and the **css stylesheet**, which is **required** for React Flow to work:

```jsx "import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';"
import { ReactFlow, Background, Controls } from '@xyflow/react';
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';
```

### Render ReactFlow

Now we create a React component, that renders our flow. The **width and height** on the
parent container are **required** because React Flow uses these dimensions.

```jsx "height: '100%', width: '100%'"
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}>
      <ReactFlow>
        <Background />
        <Controls />
      </ReactFlow>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Empty flow

That's it! You have created your first empty flow üéâ

<RemoteCodeViewer
  editorHeight="20vh"
  showEditor={false}
  route="learn/building-a-flow-1"
  framework="react"
/>

</Steps>

## Adding nodes

Now that the flow is set up, it's time to add nodes ‚Äî each node represents an element in your diagram
with a specific position and content.

<Steps> 
### Create node objects

Outside of your React component, create an array of [node](/api-reference/types/node) objects.
Each node object needs a unique `id` and a `position`. Let's also add a label to them:

```jsx
const initialNodes = [
  {
    id: 'n1',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: { label: 'Node 1' },
    type: 'input',
  },
  {
    id: 'n2',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    data: { label: 'Node 2' },
  },
];
```

### Add nodes to the flow

Now we can pass our `initialNodes` array to the `<ReactFlow />` component using the `nodes` prop:

```jsx "nodes={initialNodes}"
<ReactFlow nodes={initialNodes}>
  <Background />
  <Controls />
</ReactFlow>
```

### Flow with nodes

This gives us a flow with two labeled nodes üéâ

<RemoteCodeViewer
  editorHeight="20vh"
  showEditor={false}
  route="learn/building-a-flow-2"
  framework="react"
/>

</Steps>

We have several built-in nodes that you can explore in the [node](/api-reference/types/node) reference.
However, once you start building your own application, you will want to use [custom nodes](/learn/customization/custom-nodes).

## Adding edges

Now that we have two nodes, let's connect them with an edge.

<Steps>
### Create an edge

To create an edge, we define an array of [edge](/api-reference/types/edge) objects.
Each edge object needs to have an `id`, a `source` (where the edge begins), and a `target` (where it ends).
In this example, we use the `id` values of the two nodes we created so far (`n1` and `n2`) to define the edge:

```js
const initialEdges = [
  {
    id: 'n1-n2',
    source: 'n1',
    target: 'n2',
  },
];
```

This edge connects the node with `id: 'n1'` (the source) to the node with `id: 'n2'` (the target).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  showEditor={false}
  editorHeight="20vh"
  route="learn/building-a-flow-3"
  framework="react"
/>

### Label the edge

Let's give this edge two properties that are built into React Flow, a `label` and a `type: "step"`.

```jsx {6-7}
const initialEdges = [
  {
    id: 'n1-n2',
    source: 'n1',
    target: 'n2',
    type: 'step',
    label: 'connects with',
  },
];
```

### Basic flow

Now we have completed a basic flow with nodes and edges! üéâ

<RemoteCodeViewer
  showEditor={false}
  editorHeight="20vh"
  route="learn/building-a-flow-4"
  framework="react"
/>

</Steps>

## Full code example üèÅ

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="learn/building-a-flow-4"
  framework="react"
/>

You took your first steps in React Flow! You might have realized that you can't drag or otherwise interact with nodes. On the next page you'll learn how to make the flow interactive.
