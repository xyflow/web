# Panning and Zooming

The default pan and zoom behavior of React Flow is inspired by [slippy maps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map). You pan by dragging and zoom by scrolling. You can customize this behavior easily with the [interaction props](/api-reference/react-flow#interaction-props) on the `<ReactFlow />` component.

## Viewport Configurations

Here we will list and explain some configurations that other tools use.

### Default Viewport Controls

As mentioned above, the ReactFlow default controls are as follows:

- `pan:` pointer drag
- `zoom`: pinch or scroll
- `select`: Shift + pointer drag

<RemoteCodeViewer showEditor={false} route="learn/zoom-pan" framework="react" />

### Figma-like Viewport Controls

If you prefer figma/sketch/design tool controls you can set [`panOnScroll`](/api-reference/react-flow#panonscroll) and [`selectionOnDrag`](http://localhost:3002/api-reference/react-flow#selectionondrag) to `true`:

- `pan`: scroll, middle / right mouse drag, Space + pointer drag
- `zoom`: pinch or cmd + scroll
- `select`: pointer drag

<RemoteCodeViewer showEditor={false} route="learn/zoom-pan-2" framework="react" />

In this example we also set `selectionMode="partial"` to be able to add nodes to a selection that are only partially selected.
