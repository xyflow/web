# Panning and Zooming

The default pan and zoom behavior of React Flow is inspired by
[slippy maps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map). You pan by dragging your
pointer and zoom by scrolling. You can customize this behavior easily with the
[interaction](/api-reference/react-flow#interaction-props) and
[keyboard](/api-reference/react-flow#keyboard-props) props on the `<ReactFlow />`
component.

## Viewport configurations

Here we will list and explain some configurations that other tools use.

### Default viewport controls

As mentioned above, the ReactFlow default controls are as follows:

- `pan:` pointer drag
- `zoom:` pinch or scroll
- `select:` shift + pointer drag

<RemoteCodeViewer aspectRatio='3' route="learn/zoom-pan" framework="react" />

### Design tool viewport controls

If you prefer figma/sketch/design tool controls you can set
[`panOnScroll`](/api-reference/react-flow#panonscroll) and
[`selectionOnDrag`](/api-reference/react-flow#selectionondrag) to `true` and
[`panOnDrag`](/api-reference/react-flow#panondrag) to `false`:

- `pan:` scroll, middle / right mouse drag, space + pointer drag
- `zoom:` pinch or cmd + scroll
- `select:` pointer drag

<RemoteCodeViewer aspectRatio='3' route="learn/zoom-pan-2" framework="react" />

In this example we also set `selectionMode="partial"` to be able to add nodes to a
selection that are only partially selected.
