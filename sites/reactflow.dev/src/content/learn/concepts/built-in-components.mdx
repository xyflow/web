# Built-In Plugins

React Flow comes with several built-in plugins that can be passed as children to the [`<ReactFlow />`](/api-reference/react-flow) component.

## MiniMap

If your flow gets bigger, you might want to get an overview quickly. For this we have built the [`MiniMap`](/api-reference/components/minimap) component:

<RemoteCodeViewer showEditor={false} route="learn/mini-map" framework="react" />

## Controls

React Flow comes with a customizable controls bar, that you can use by importing the [`Controls`](/api-reference/components/controls) component.

<RemoteCodeViewer showEditor={false} route="learn/controls" framework="react" />

## Background

The [`Background`](/api-reference/components/background) component lets you add common background styles to the React Flow viewport. You can choose between grid, lines, or dots, and customize the color, size and thickness.

<RemoteCodeViewer showEditor={false} route="learn/background" framework="react" />

## Panel

The [`Panel`](/api-reference/components/panel) component is a helper component to display content on top of the React Flow viewport. 

<RemoteCodeViewer showEditor={false} route="learn/panel" framework="react" />

## Node Toolbar and Resizer

The [`<NodeToolbar />`](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar) plugin lets you render a toolbar attached to a node. [Example](/examples/misc/node-toolbar).

The [`<NodeResizer />`](/api-reference/components/node-resizer) plugin makes it easy to add resize functionality to your nodes. [Example](/examples/nodes/resizable-node).
