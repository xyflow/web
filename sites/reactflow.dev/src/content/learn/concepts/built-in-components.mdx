# Built-In Plugins

React Flow comes with several additional components. In this guide we show you how to use them. We are using our [previous example code](/learn/concepts/core-concepts) here.

## MiniMap

If your flow gets bigger, you might want to get an overview quickly. For this we have built the [`MiniMap` component](/api-reference/components/minimap). You can easily add it to your flow by adding it as a children:

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/mini-map" framework="react" />

## Controls

React Flow comes with a customizable controls bar, that you can use by importing the [`Controls` component](/api-reference/components/controls)

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/controls" framework="react" />

## Background

If you want to display the pattern background, you can use the [`Background` component](/api-reference/components/background)

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/background" framework="react" />

## Panel

A helper component to display content on top of the React Flow viewport. [`Panel` component](/api-reference/components/panel)

<RemoteCodeViewer route="learn/panel" framework="react" />

## Node Toolbar and Resizer

The [`<NodeToolbar />`](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar) plugin lets you render a toolbar attached to a node.[Example](/examples/misc/node-toolbar).

The [`<NodeResizer />`](/api-reference/components/node-resizer) plugin makes it easy to add resize functionality to your nodes. [Example](/examples/nodes/resizable-node).
