# Hooks and Providers

## ReactFlowProvider

The ReactFlowProvider is a context provider that allows you to access the internal state of the flow, such as nodes, edges, and viewport, from anywhere in your component tree even outside the `ReactFlow` component. It is typically used at the top level of your application.

There are several cases where you might need to use the [`ReactFlowProvider`](/api-reference/react-flow-provider) component:

- Many of the [hooks](/api-reference/hooks) we provide rely on this component to work.
- You want to access the internal state of the flow outside of the `ReactFlow` component.
- You are working with multiple flows on a page.
- You are using a client-side router.

## useReactFlow

The [`useReactFlow` hook](/api-reference/hooks/use-react-flow) provides access to the [`ReactFlowInstance`](/api-reference/types/react-flow-instance) and its methods. It allows you to manipulate nodes, edges, and the viewport programmatically.

This example illustrates how to use the `useReactFlow` hook.
