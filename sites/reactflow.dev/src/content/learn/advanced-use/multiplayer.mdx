# Realtime Multiplayer Collaboration Best Practices

In our [Collaborative Flow Pro Example](/examples/interaction/collaborative), we
show a realtime multiplayer collaboration flow using [React Flow](/) and
[Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs). While this is a great example, you may be
wondering how to implement realtime multiplayer collaboration with React Flow and other libraries and backends.

In this guide, we will explore some best practices for integrating multiplayer
collaboration in your React Flow application, focusing mainly on **the
high-level application logic** you need to implement.

We will answer the following questions:
- What React Flow state should I sync with the backend?
- What parts of state can be safely persisted, and what parts should be simply broadcasted to other clients?
- How to handle conflicts when multiple clients try to update the same state?
- How to display the collaboration state to the users?
