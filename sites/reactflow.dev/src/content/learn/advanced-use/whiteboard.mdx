# Whiteboard Features

React Flow is designed for building node-based UIs like workflow editors, flowcharts and
diagrams. Even if React Flow is not made for creating whiteboard applications, you might
want to integrate common whiteboard features. These examples show how to add drawing
capabilities to your applications when you need to annotate or sketch alongside your nodes
and edges.

## Examples

### ✏️ Freehand draw (Pro)

Draw smooth curves on your React Flow pane. Useful for annotations or sketching around
existing nodes.

**Features:**

- Mouse/touch drawing
- Adjustable brush size and color
- converts drawn paths into custom nodes

**Common uses:**

- Annotating flowcharts
- Adding notes to diagrams
- Sketching ideas around nodes

### 🎯 Lasso selection

Select multiple elements by drawing a freeform selection area with an option to include
partially selected elements.

**Features:**

- Freeform selection shapes
- partial selection of elements

**Common uses:**

- Selecting nodes and annotations together
- Complex selections in mixed content

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/whiteboard/lasso-selection"
  framework="react"
/>

### 🧹 Eraser

Remove items by "erasing" over them. Uses collision detection to determine what to delete.

**Features:**

- Collision-based erasing
- Visual eraser cursor

**Common uses:**

- Removing parts of a flow

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/whiteboard/eraser"
  framework="react"
/>

### 📐 Rectangle draw

Create rectangular shapes by clicking and dragging. Good for highlighting areas or
creating backgrounds for node groups.

**Features:**

- Click-and-drag rectangle creation
- Customizable colors

**Common uses:**

- Creating background containers
- Grouping related nodes visually
- Highlighting sections of diagrams

## Whiteboard libraries

If you are looking for a more complete whiteboard solution, consider using libraries that
are specifically designed for whiteboard applications like [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev/)
or [Excalidraw](https://docs.excalidraw.com/). These libraries provide a full set of
features for collaborative drawing, shapes, text, and more.
