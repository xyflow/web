title: Zoom Transitions
description: Change the animation speed when the viewport is zoomed or moved

import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared/server';

Smooth transitions from one viewport to another are built-in. You can pass a `duration` option parameter to define the animation duration for every function that alters the viewport ([`zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `zoomTo`, `setViewport`, `fitView`, `setCenter`, `fitBounds`](/api-reference/types/react-flow-instance#viewport)).
