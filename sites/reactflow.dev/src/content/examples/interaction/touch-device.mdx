<ExampleLayout>
You can connect nodes on a touch device by tapping two handles in a row. In this example we increased the size of the handles so that they are better tappable. You can disable this behavoir by setting the [`connectOnClick` prop](/api-reference/react-flow#interaction) to `false`.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/interaction/touch-device" framework="react" />
