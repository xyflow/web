import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared/server';

You can connect nodes on a touch device by tapping two handles in a row. In this example we increased the size of the handles so that they are better tappable. You can disable this behavoir by setting the [`connectOnClick` prop](/api-reference/react-flow#interaction) to `false`.
