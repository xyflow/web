import { RemoteCodeViewer } from '@/components/remote-code-viewer';

Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular React component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behaviour.
