import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared/server';

The `useReactFlow` hook exports [helpers to check intersections](/api-reference/types/react-flow-instance#intersections) of nodes and areas. In this example you can drag a node and get a visual feedback when it intersects with another node.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/nodes/intersections" framework="react" />
