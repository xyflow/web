<ExampleLayout>

React Flow provides a simple built-in animation for the default edge type, but
it is possible to create more advanced animations by using custom edges. Below
are a collection of examples showing different ways an edge path might be used
in

## Animating SVG elements

It is possible to animate an SVG element along a path using the `<animateMotion />`
element. This example creates a custom edge that animates a circle along the edge
path.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/edges/animating-edges-svg"
  framework="react"
/>

## Animating other nodes

If you want to animate more than SVG along an edge, you can do that with the
Web Animations API. This example demonstrates how to animate another node in the
flow along an edge path by using the `offsetPath` property and animating the
`offsetDistance` property.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/edges/animating-edges-node"
  framework="react"
/>

There are some important details in this example to take note of:

- The animated node has its [`draggable`](/api-reference/types/node#draggable)
  property set to `false` while the animation is running. This prevents a user
  moving the node around and breaking the animation path.

- The animation path and the animation itself are set up in separate `useEffect`
  hooks. This lets the animation continue playing smoothly even if the edge path
  is recalculated (for example when the source or target nodes are dragged.)
