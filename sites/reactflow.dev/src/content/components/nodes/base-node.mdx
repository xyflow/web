# Base Node

A node wrapper with some basic styling used for creating a shared design among all nodes in your application.
Similarly to [shadcn ui's card](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card) the components file exports:

- The `BaseNode` main container,
- The `BaseNodeHeader` container where you would usually add actions and a `BaseNodeHeaderTitle`
- The `BaseNodeContent` container where you would add the main contents of the node.
- The `BaseNodeFooter` container where you may want to add extra information, or visible actions.

You should use the `nodrag` [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility
class on buttons and interactive components of your node, to disable dragging
the node inside the flow, for example when clicking on buttons or sliders that you may
want to add in the your custom node.

## Theming

To customize the visual appearance of your custom nodes, you can simply use
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. All of the React Flow
components are based on [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and you should follow
the [shadcn UI theming guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) to customize aspects like typography and colors
in your application.

In most occasions though, when developing custom nodes, you may simply need to
add custom Tailwind CSS classes. All of the `BaseNode` components are just light wrappers around `<div>`.

For example, to change the border color of a node, based on an hypothetical execution status,
you can pass extra `className`s:

```tsx
// Assuming your component is receiving a `data` prop
export const BaseNodeSimpleDemo = memo(({ data }: NodeProps) => {
  return (
    <BaseNode
      className={cn('w-[350px] p-0 hover:ring-orange-500', {
        'border-orange-500': data.status === 'loading',
        'border-red-500': data.status === 'error',
      })}
    >
      {/* Your custom node definiton goes here */}
    </BaseNode>
  );
});
```
