# Workflow Editor

The Workflow Editor template is a Next.js-based application designed to help you quickly create, manage, and visualize workflows. Built with [React Flow Components](https://reactflow.dev/components) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), this project provides a highly customizable foundation for building and extending workflow editors.

## Tech Stack

- **React Flow Components**: The project uses [React Flow Components](https://reactflow.dev/components) to build nodes. These components are designed to help you quickly get up to speed on projects.

- **shadcn CLI**: The project uses the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) to manage UI components. This tool builds on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, making it easy to add and customize UI elements.

- **State Management with Zustand**: The application uses Zustand for state management, providing a simple and efficient way to manage the state of nodes, edges, and other workflow-related data.

## Features

- **Automatic Layouting**: Utilizes the [ELKjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) layout engine to automatically arrange nodes and edges.
- **Drag-and-Drop Sidebar**: Add and arrange nodes using a drag-and-drop mechanism.
- **Customizable Components**: Uses React Flow Components and the shadcn library to create highly-customizable nodes and edges.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggles between light and dark themes, managed through the Zustand store.
- **Runner Functionality**: Executes and monitors nodes sequentially with a workflow runner.
