# New guide published!

We've added a new guide to show folks how to create their own custom edges. This
guide breaks down what the [`<BaseEdge />`](/api-reference/components/base-edge)
and [`<EdgeLabelRenderer />`](/api-reference/components/edge-label-renderer)
components are for, and shows how to use some of the
[path utilities](/api-reference/utils) React Flow provides.

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/CustomEdge2"
  additionalFiles={['CustomEdge.js']}
  editorHeight={500}
/>

You can check it out in the customization section of our learning resources
[here](/learn/customization/custom-edges).
