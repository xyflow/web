# New custom edges guide!

We've added a new guide to show folks how to create their own custom edges. This
guide breaks down what the [`<BaseEdge />`](/api-reference/components/base-edge)
and [`<EdgeLabelRenderer />`](/api-reference/components/edge-label-renderer)
components are for, and shows how to use some of the
[path utilities](/api-reference/utils) React Flow provides.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${
    process?.env?.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL ?? exampleUrl
  }/learn/custom-edge-2/source.json`}
  preview={`${
    process?.env?.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL ?? exampleUrl
  }/learn/custom-edge-2/index.html`}
  framework="react"
  showEditor={false}
/>
