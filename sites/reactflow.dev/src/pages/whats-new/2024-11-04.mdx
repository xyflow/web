# Introducing React Flow Components - powered by shadcn CLI

We've been interested in developing reusable components for React Flow for a
while now. With the recent releases of shadcn CLI, we've made that happen! Some
interesting components from the initial set include:

- A database schema node that makes it easy to visualise tables and relationships
  between columns.

- A zoom slider for more convenient control over the viewport zoom level.

- Debugging components that make it easier to inspect a node's properties and the
  state of your flow.

We're excited to see what you build with these components, and we're looking
forward to hearing your feedback! Please open issues on our [web repo](https://github.com/xyflow/web/issues)
if you run into any problems or have any suggestions for new components, and definitely
tweet at us at [@xyflowdev](https://x.com/xyflowdev) if you build something cool
with them!

If you want to read the entire relase blog post, you can find it on the xyflow
blog [here](https://xyflow.com/blog/react-flow-components).
