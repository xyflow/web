# New edge examples

Here's a care drop of new edge examples including how to animate nodes along an
edge path, how to create temporary edges, and a demo of every connection event.
We hope this new bundle of examples will help you level up your flow game!

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${
    process?.env?.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL ?? exampleUrl
  }/examples/edges/animating-edges-node/source.json`}
  preview={`${
    process?.env?.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL ?? exampleUrl
  }/examples/edges/animating-edges-node/index.html`}
  framework="react"
  showEditor={false}
/>

This is a breakdown of what's been added:

- [Two examples in one](/examples/edges/animating-edges) showing how to animate
  SVG elements and other nodes along an edge path.

- A new example showing how to create a [temporary edge](/examples/edges/temporary-edges)
  attached to only one handle. These edges can be picked back up and connected
  at a later time.

- We have a lot of events related to connections so we've created a
  [small demo](/examples/interaction/connection-events) showing every connection
  and event and when they are triggered.
