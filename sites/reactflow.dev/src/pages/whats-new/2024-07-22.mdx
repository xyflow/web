# New tutorial – Create a slide show presentation with React Flow

We recently published the findings from our React Flow 2023 end-of-year survey
with an [interactive presentation](/developer-survey-2023) of the key findings,
using React Flow itself. There were lots of useful bits built into this slideshow
app, so we wanted to share how we built it!

<ExampleViewer
style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9' }}
codePath="blog-flows/presentation/App"
additionalFiles={['Slide.tsx', 'slides.ts', 'index.css']}
dependencies={{ 'react-remark': '2.1.0' }}
showEditor={false}
isTypescript
/>
