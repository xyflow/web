# New node toolbar example!

Buried away in our API reference is the documentation for our
[`<NodeToolbar />`](/api-reference/node-toolbar) component. We've been missing
an example to accompany it though, so we've published a new example to show how
it can be used. Check it out [here](/examples/nodes/prevent-cycles).

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/NodeToolbar"
  showEditor={false}
  editorHeight="600px"
/>
