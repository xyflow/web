# What's New?

We refreshed the React Flow docs in November 2023, so things are arranged a little differently:

"Docs" is now **[Learn](learn)**

"API" is now **[Reference](/api-reference)**

"How to" blog posts are now in **Learn > [Tutorials](/learn/tutorials)**

## Why?

So far the docs have been growing organically since 2019, which made them a bit of a mess. While we worked on a website redesign, we decided it was time to rethink the concept of our docs to create a better developer experience. So we hope that things become a bit easier to find for both experienced React Flow users and newcomers.

We also did a change of tech stack along the way. We were using Docusaurus in our old documentation, and now we're using Nextra. Cool beans.
