# What's New?

We refreshed the React Flow docs in November 2023, so things might look a little different around here:

**Docs is now called [Learn](/learn)**. This section aims to answer the question of "how do I use X?"

**API is now called [Reference](/api-reference)**. This section answers the question "what is this thing?" A big change from the previous version of our docs is that all of our types, components, hooks, and util functions now get their own page now.

"How to" blog posts now live in **Learn > [Tutorials](/learn/tutorials)**

## Why the changes?

So far the docs have been growing organically since 2019, without any sort of overarching concept. While we worked on a website redesign, we decided it was time to rethink how folks are using our docs so that we can create a better developer experience. Our hope is that these changes make the docs easier to use for both experienced React Flow users and newcomers.

We also did a change of tech stack along the way. We were using Docusaurus, and now we're using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/). Cool beans.

If you find anything to change or improve, just click on the "Edit this page" link on the right-side of any page in our docs.
