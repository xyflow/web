# React Flow Components

This is a collection of useful components that you can easily integrate into your React Flow application. It utilizes the new [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli), which builds on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

## Prequisites

You need to have `shadcn` and `tailwind` configured in your project. If you haven't installed it, you can follow the steps explained in the [shadcn installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation). If `shadcn` and `tailwind` are part of your project, you can initialize shadcn-ui by running:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn init
```

If you want to understand why we are building this on top of shadcn, head over to our [motivation](/components/motivation).

## Usage

Find a component you like and run the command to add it to your project.

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name
```

- This command copies the component code inside your components folder. You can change this folder by adding an alias inside your `shadcn.config.js`.

- It automatically installs all necessary dependencies

- It utilizes previously added and even modified components or asks you if you'd like to overwrite them.

- It uses your existing tailwind configuration.
