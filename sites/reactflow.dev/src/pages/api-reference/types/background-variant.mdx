# BackgroundVariant

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/additional-components/Background/types.ts)

The three variants are exported as an enum for convenience. You can either import
the enum and use it like `BackgroundVariant.Lines` or you can use the raw string
value directly.

```ts
export enum BackgroundVariant {
  Lines = 'lines',
  Dots = 'dots',
  Cross = 'cross',
}
```
