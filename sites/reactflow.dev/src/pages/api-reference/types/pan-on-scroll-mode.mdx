# PanOnScrollMode

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/6e237ad2b77de8add92cb4e19ada3cdd8773d53c/packages/core/src/types/general.ts#L103C1-L107C2)

This enum is used to set the different modes of panning the viewport when the
user scrolls. The `Free` mode allows the user to pan in any direction by scrolling
with a device like a trackpad. The `Vertical` and `Horizontal` modes restrict
scroll panning to only the vertical or horizontal axis, respectively.

```ts
export enum PanOnScrollMode {
  Free = 'free',
  Vertical = 'vertical',
  Horizontal = 'horizontal',
}
```
