While [`PanelPosition`](/api-reference/types/panel-position) can be used to place a component in the
corners of a container, the `Position` enum is less precise and used primarily
in relation to edges and handles.

```ts
export enum Position {
  Left = 'left',
  Top = 'top',
  Right = 'right',
  Bottom = 'bottom',
}
```
