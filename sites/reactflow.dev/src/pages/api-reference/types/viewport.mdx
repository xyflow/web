# Viewport

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/general.ts/#L75-L76)

Internally, React Flow maintains a coordinate system that is independent of the
rest of the page. The `Viewport` type tells you where in that system your flow
is currently being display at and how zoomed in or out it is.

```ts
export type Viewport = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  zoom: number;
};
```

## Fields

<PropsTable {...viewportFields} />

## Notes

- A `Transform` has the same properties as the viewport, but they represent
  different things. Make sure you don't get them muddled up or things will start
  to look weird!
