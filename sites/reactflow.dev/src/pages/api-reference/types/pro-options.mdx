# ProOptions

By default, we render a small attribution in the corner of your flows that links back
to the project. Anyone is free to remove this attribution whether they're a Pro subscriber
or not but we ask that you take a quick look at our
[removing attribution](/learn/troubleshooting/remove-attribution) guide before doing so.

```ts
type ProOptions = {
  hideAttribution?: boolean;
};
```
