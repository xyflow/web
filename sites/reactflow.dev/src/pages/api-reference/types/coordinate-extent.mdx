# CoordinateExtent

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/system/src/types/utils.ts/#L36-L37)

A coordinate extent represents two points in a coordinate system: one in the top
left corner and one in the bottom right corner. It is used to represent the
bounds of nodes in the flow or the bounds of the viewport.

```ts
export type CoordinateExtent = [[number, number], [number, number]];
```

## Notes

- Props that expect a `CoordinateExtent` usually default to `[[-∞, -∞], [+∞, +∞]]`
  to represent an unbounded extent.
