# useConnection

[Source on GitHub]()

The `useConnection` hook returns the current connection state when there is an active connection interaction. If no connection interaction is active, it returns `null` for every property. A typical use case for this hook is to colorize handles based on a certain condition (e.g. if the connection is valid or not).

```tsx
import { useConnection } from '@xyflow/react';

export default function () {
  const connection = useConnection();

  return (
    {connection &&
      <div>
        Someone is trying to make a connection from {connection.fromNode} to this one.
      </div>
    }
    {!connection &&
      <div>
        There are currently no incoming connections!
      </div>
    }
    )
}
```
