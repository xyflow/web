[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/core/src/utils/graph.ts/#L97)

A handy utility to update an existing [`Edge`](/api-reference/types/edge) with new properties.
This searches your edge array for an edge with a matching `id` and updates its
properties with the connection you provide.

```js
const onReconnect = useCallback(
  (oldEdge: Edge, newConnection: Connection) => setEdges((els) => reconnectEdge(oldEdge, newConnection, els)),
  []
);
```
