# applyEdgeChanges()

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/main/packages/react/src/utils/changes.ts/#L167)

Various events on the [`<ReactFlow />`](/api-reference/react-flow) component can produce an
[`EdgeChange`](/api-reference/types/edge-change) that describes how to update the edges of your
flow in some way. If you don't need any custom behaviour, this util can be used to
take an array of these changes and apply them to your edges.

```js
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { ReactFlow, applyEdgeChanges } from '@xyflow/react';

export default function Flow() {
  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState([]);
  const [edges, setEdges] = useState([]);
  const onEdgesChange = useCallback(
    (changes) => {
      setEdges((oldEdges) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, oldEdges));
    },
    [setEdges],
  );

  return (
    <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges} onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange} />
  );
}
```

## Signature

<PropsTable {...signature} />

## Notes

- If you don't need any custom behaviour, the [`useEdgesState`](/api-reference/hooks/use-edges-state)
  hook conviniently wraps this util and React's `useState` hook for you and might
  be simpler to use.
