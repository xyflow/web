# Building a Flow

import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';

In this section we are explaining how to create a controlled flow component. Now that you've installed React Flow into your React project, all files are in place to start using React Flow.

## Getting Started

Let's create an empty flow with a controls panel and a background. For this we need to import the components from the `reactflow` package:

```js
import { ReactFlow, Background, Controls } from '@xyflow/react';
```

We can now use the components to render an empty flow:

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/GettingStarted1"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

There are three important things to keep in mind here:

1. You need to **import the styles**. Otherwise React Flow won't work.
2. The **parent container needs a width and a height**, because React Flow uses its parent dimensions.
3. If you have **multiple flows on one page**, you need to pass a unique `id` prop to each component to make React Flow work properly.

## Adding Nodes

Now that the flow is set up, let's add some nodes. To do this, you need to create an array with [node objects](/api-reference/types/node) like this:

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1', // required
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, // required
  },
];
```

These nodes can now be added to the flow:

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/GettingStarted2"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

Let's add another node, configure labels and use the node type `input` for the first node.

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: { label: 'Hello' },
    type: 'input',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    data: { label: 'World' },
  },
];
```

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/GettingStarted3"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

There are plenty of ways to configure nodes. You can see the full list of options on the [node option site](/api-reference/types/node).

This looks good. Let's attach these two nodes.

## Adding an Edge

Now that we have two nodes, let's connect them with an edge.

To make an edge, we need to specify two attributes: the source node (where the edge begins) and the target node (where the edge ends). We use the `id` of the two nodes to specify this (in our example, our two nodes have ids of "1" and "2"):

```js
const edges = [{ id: '1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];
```

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/GettingStarted4"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

Let's give this edge two properties that are built into React Flow, a `label` and a different `type`.

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/GettingStarted5"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

You made your first edge, nice work! You might have realised that you can't drag or select nodes. In the next part you'll learn how to make the flow interactive.
