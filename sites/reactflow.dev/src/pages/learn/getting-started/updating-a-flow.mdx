# Updating a Flow

## Things to avoid

- Be extra careful when using [`setNodes`](/reference/types/ReactFlowInstance#setnodes)
  in a `useEffect` hook. A common source of trouble is unconditionally calling
  `setNodes` in an effect hook with your `nodes` as a dependency: this can easily
  spiral into an infinite loop!
