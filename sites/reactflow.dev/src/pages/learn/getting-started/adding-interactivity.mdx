# Adding Interactivity

import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

Let's make it so we can select, drag, and remove nodes and edges.

<Callout type="info">
  In this Getting Started tutorial, we are going to use a ["controlled
  component"](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), which
  is typically the best and most flexible way to use React Flow in your own
  applications. You can also use React Flow in an [uncontrolled
  way](/docs/guides/uncontrolled-flow/).
</Callout>

## Handle Change Events

First let's import a few things. To manage the changes in React Flow, we'll be using `useState` and the two helper function `applyEdgeChanges` and `applyNodeChanges` from React Flow.

```js
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { ReactFlow, applyEdgeChanges, applyNodeChanges } from '@xyflow/react';
```

We're going to set up states for both the nodes and edges:

```js
const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(initialNodes);
const [edges, setEdges] = useState(initialEdges);
```

Directly beneath that, we'll add these two functions:

```js
const onNodesChange = useCallback(
  (changes) => setNodes((nds) => applyNodeChanges(changes, nds)),
  [],
);
const onEdgesChange = useCallback(
  (changes) => setEdges((eds) => applyEdgeChanges(changes, eds)),
  [],
);
```

When you drag or select a node, the `onNodeChange` handler gets called. With help of the `applyNodeChanges` function you can then apply those changes to your current node state. Putting everything together, it should look like this:

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/MakeItInteractive1"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

Now if you run your application, you'll be able to click and drag the components, and the UI will update based on those movements.

## Handle Connections

One last piece is missing: connecting nodes manually. For this we need to implement an `onConnect` handler and pass it to the `<ReactFlow />` component as well:

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="api-flows/MakeItInteractive2"
  applyStyles={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 400, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

Try to connect the two nodes by dragging from on handle to another one. That's it. You've built a fully interactive flow.

That's it for now :) You made it! If you want to move on, we recommend to check out the ["Custom Nodes" guide](/learn/customization/custom-nodes).
