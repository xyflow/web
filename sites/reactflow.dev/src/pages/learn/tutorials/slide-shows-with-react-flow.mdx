We recently published the findings from our React Flow 2023 end-of-year survey with an [interactive presentation](/developer-survey-2023) of the key findings, using React Flow itself. There were lots of useful bits built into this slideshow app, so we wanted to share how we built it!

By the end of this tutorial, you will have built a presentation app with

- Support for markdown slides
- Keyboard navigation around the viewport
- Automatic layouting
- Click-drag panning navigation (Ã  la Prezi)

Along the way, you'll learn a bit about the basics of layouting algorithms, creating static flows, and custom nodes.

Once you're done, the app will look like this!

To follow along
with this tutorial we'll assume you have a basic understanding of
[React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and
[React Flow](/learn/concepts/terms-and-definitions), but if you get stuck on the
way feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RVmnytFmGW)!

Here's the [repo with the final code](https://github.com/xyflow/react-flow-slide-show)
if you'd like to skip ahead or refer to it as we go.

Let's get started!

## Setting up the project

We like to recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) when starting new React Flow
projects, and this time we'll use TypeScript too. You can scaffold a new project
with the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts
```

If you'd prefer to follow along with JavaScript feel free to use the `react`
template instead. You can also follow along in your browser by using our codesandbox
templates:

    icon={
      <div className="rounded-full w-10 h-10 bg-yellow-200 text-gray-700 font-black flex items-center justify-center">
        JS
      </div>
    }
  />

        TS
      </div>
    }
  />
</Cards>

Besides React Flow we only need to pull in one dependency, [`react-remark`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-remark),
to help us render markdown in our slides.

```bash
npm install reactflow react-remark
```

We'll modify the generated `main.tsx` to include React Flow's styles, as well as
wrap the app in a `<ReactFlowProvider />` to make sure we can access the React Flow
instance inside our components;

```tsx filename="main.tsx" {3,7,12,20}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { ReactFlowProvider } from '@xyflow/react';

import App from './App';

import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ReactFlowProvider>
      {/* The parent element of the React Flow component needs a width and a height
          to work properly. If you're styling your app as you follow along, you
          can remove this div and apply styles to the #root element in your CSS.
       */}
      <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}>
        <App />
      </div>
    </ReactFlowProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

This tutorial is going to gloss over the styling of the app, so feel free to use
any CSS framework or styling solution you're familiar with. If you're going to
style your app differently from just writing CSS, for example with
[Styled Components](/examples/styling/styled-components) or
[Tailwind CSS](/examples/styling/tailwind), you can skip the import to `index.css`.

<Callout>
  How you style your app is up to you, but you must **always** include React
  Flow's styles! If you don't need the default styles, at a minimum you should
  include the base styles from `reactflow/dist/base.css`.
</Callout>

Each slide of our presentation will be a node on the canvas, so let's create a new file `Slide.tsx` that will be our custom node used to render each slide.

```tsx filename="Slide.tsx"
import { type Node, type NodeProps } from '@xyflow/react';

export const SLIDE_WIDTH = 1920;
export const SLIDE_HEIGHT = 1080;

export type SlideNode = Node<SlideData, 'slide'>

export type SlideData = {};

const style = {
  width: `${SLIDE_WIDTH}px`,
  height: `${SLIDE_HEIGHT}px`,
} satisfies React.CSSProperties;

export function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNode>) {
  return (
    <article className="slide nodrag" style={style}>
      <div>Hello, React Flow!</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

We're setting the slide width and height as constants here (rather than styling
the node in CSS) because we'll want access to those dimensions later on. We've
also stubbed out the `SlideData` type so we can properly type the component's
props.

The last thing to do is to register our new custom node and show something on the
screen.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';
import { Slide } from './Slide.tsx';

const nodeTypes = {
  slide: Slide,
};

export default export default function App() {
  const nodes = [
    { id: '0', type: 'slide', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: {} },
  ];

  return <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} nodeTypes={nodeTypes} fitView />;
}
```

<Callout>
  It's important to remember to define your `nodeTypes` object _outside_ of the
  component (or to use React's `useMemo` hook)! When the `nodeTypes` object
  changes, the entire flow is re-rendered.
</Callout>

With the basics put together, you can start the development server by running
`npm run dev` and see the following:

<Bleed>
  <BlogExampleViewer
    style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9' }}
    codePath="blog-flows/presentation/Scaffold"
    additionalFiles={['Slide.tsx', 'index.css']}
    dependencies={{ 'react-remark': '2.1.0' }}
    showEditor={false}
    isTypescript
  />
</Bleed>

Not super exciting yet, but let's add markdown rendering and create a few slides
side by side!

## Rendering markdown

We want to make it easy to add content to our slides, so we'd like the ability
to write [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) in our slides.
If you're not familiar, Markdown is a simple markup language for creating formatted
text documents. If you've ever written a README on GitHub, you've used Markdown!

Thanks to the `react-remark` package we installed
earlier, this step is a simple one. We can use the `<Remark />` component to render a string of markdown
content into our slides.

```tsx filename="Slide.tsx" {2,9-11,21}
import { type Node, type NodeProps } from '@xyflow/react';
import { Remark } from 'react-remark';

export const SLIDE_WIDTH = 1920;
export const SLIDE_HEIGHT = 1080;

export type SlideNode = Node<SlideData, 'slide'>

export type SlideData = {
  source: string;
};

const style = {
  width: `${SLIDE_WIDTH}px`,
  height: `${SLIDE_HEIGHT}px`,
} satisfies React.CSSProperties;

export function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNode>) {
  return (
    <article className="slide nodrag" style={style}>
      <Remark>{data.source}</Remark>
    </article>
  );
}
```

In React Flow, nodes can have data stored on them that can be used during rendering.
In this case we're storing the markdown content to display by adding a `source`
property to the `SlideData` type and passing that to the `<Remark />` component.
We can update our hardcoded nodes with some markdown content to see it in action:

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {2, 10-27, 34}
import { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';
import { Slide, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';

const nodeTypes = {
  slide: Slide,
};

export default export default function App() {
  const nodes = [
    {
      id: '0',
      type: 'slide',
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      data: { source: '# Hello, React Flow!' },
    },
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'slide',
      position: { x: SLIDE_WIDTH, y: 0 },
      data: { source: '...' },
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      type: 'slide',
      position: { x: SLIDE_WIDTH * 2, y: 0 },
      data: { source: '...' },
    },
  ];

  return <ReactFlow
    nodes={nodes}
    nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
    fitView
    minZoom={0.1}
  />;
}
```

Note that we've added the `minZoom` prop to the `<ReactFlow />` component. Our
slides are quite large, and the default minimum zoom level is not enough to zoom
out and see multiple slides at once.

<Bleed>
  <BlogExampleViewer
    style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9' }}
    codePath="blog-flows/presentation/RenderingMarkdown"
    additionalFiles={['Slide.tsx', 'index.css']}
    dependencies={{ 'react-remark': '2.1.0' }}
    showEditor={false}
    isTypescript
  />
</Bleed>

In the nodes array above, we've made sure to space the slides out by doing some
manual math with the `SLIDE_WIDTH` constant. In the next section we'll come up
with an algorithm to automatically lay out the slides in a grid.

## Laying out the nodes

We often get asked how to automatically lay out nodes in a flow, and we have some
documentation on how to use common layouting libraries like dagre and d3-hierarchy
in our [layouting guide](/learn/layouting/layouting). Here you'll be writing your own super-simple layouting algorithm, which gets a bit nerdy, but stick with us!

For our presentation app we'll construct a simple grid layout by starting from
0,0 and updating the x or y coordinates any time we have a new slide to the left,
right, up, or down.

First, we need to update our `SlideData` type to include optional ids for the slides
to the left, right, up, and down of the current slide.

```tsx filename="Slide.tsx" {3-6}
export type SlideData = {
  source: string;
  left?: string;
  up?: string;
  down?: string;
  right?: string;
};
```

Storing this information on the node data directly gives us some useful benefits:

- We can write fully declarative slides without worrying about the concept of
  nodes and edges

- We can compute the layout of the presentation by visiting connecting slides

- We can add navigation buttons to each slide to navigate between them automatically.
  We'll handle that in a later step.

The magic happens in a function we're going to define called `slidesToElements`.
This function will take an object containing all our slides addressed by their
id, and an id for the slide to start at. Then it will work through each connecting
slide to build an array of nodes and edges that we can pass to the `<ReactFlow />`
component.

The algorithm will go something like this:

- Push the initial slide's id and the position `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` onto a stack.
- While that stack is not empty...

  - Pop the current position and slide id off the stack.

  - Look up the slide data by id.
  - Push a new node onto the nodes array with the current id, position, and slide
    data.
  - Add the slide's id to a set of visited slides.
  - For every direction (left, right, up, down)...

    - Make sure the slide has not already been visited.
    - Take the current position and update the x or y coordinate by adding or
      subtracting `SLIDE_WIDTH` or `SLIDE_HEIGHT` depending on the direction.
    - Push the new position and the new slide's id onto a stack.
    - Push a new edge onto the edges array connecting the current slide to the
      new slide.

    - Repeat for the remaining directions...

If all goes to plan, we should be able to take a stack of slides shown below and
turn them into a neatly laid out grid!

<Image src="/img/tutorials/presentation/ideal-layout.png" wide />

Let's see the code. In a file called `slides.ts` add the following:

```tsx filename="slides.ts"
import { SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH, SLIDE_HEIGHT } from './Slide';

export const slidesToElements = (
  initial: string,
  slides: Record<string, SlideData>,
) => {
  // Push the initial slide's id and the position `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` onto a stack.
  const stack = [{ id: initial, position: { x: 0, y: 0 } }];
  const visited = new Set();
  const nodes = [];
  const edges = [];

  // While that stack is not empty...
  while (stack.length) {
    // Pop the current position and slide id off the stack.
    const { id, position } = stack.pop();
    // Look up the slide data by id.
    const data = slides[id];
    const node = { id, type: 'slide', position, data };

    // Push a new node onto the nodes array with the current id, position, and slide
    // data.
    nodes.push(node);
    // add the slide's id to a set of visited slides.
    visited.add(id);

    // For every direction (left, right, up, down)...
    // Make sure the slide has not already been visited.
    if (data.left && !visited.has(data.left)) {
      // Take the current position and update the x or y coordinate by adding or
      // subtracting `SLIDE_WIDTH` or `SLIDE_HEIGHT` depending on the direction.
      const nextPosition = {
        x: position.x - SLIDE_WIDTH,
        y: position.y,
      };

      // Push the new position and the new slide's id onto a stack.
      stack.push({ id: data.left, position: nextPosition });
      // Push a new edge onto the edges array connecting the current slide to the
      // new slide.
      edges.push({ id: `${id}->${data.left}`, source: id, target: data.left });
    }

    // Repeat for the remaining directions...
  }

  return { nodes, edges };
};
```

We've left out the code for the right, up, and down directions for brevity, but
the logic is the same for each direction. We've also included the same breakdown
of the algorithm as comments, to help you navigate the code.

Below is a demo app of the layouting algorithm, you can edit the `slides` object
to see how adding slides to different directions affects the layout. For example,
try extending 4's data to include `down: '5'` and see how the layout updates.

<Bleed>
  <BlogExampleViewer
    style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9' }}
    codePath="blog-flows/presentation/LayoutDemo"
    additionalFiles={['Flow.tsx', 'index.css']}
    showEditor
    isTypescript
  />
</Bleed>

If you spend a little time playing with this demo, you'll likely run across two
limitations of this algorithm:

1. It is possible to construct a layout that overlaps two slides in the same
   position.

2. The algorithm will ignore nodes that cannot be reached from the initial slide.

Addressing these shortcomings is totally possible, but a bit beyond the scope of
this tutorial. If you give a shot, be sure to share your solution with us on the
[discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RVmnytFmGW)!

With our layouting algorithm written, we can hop back to `App.tsx` and remove the
hardcoded nodes array in favor of the new `slidesToElements` function.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {2,3,5-9,15-16,24}
import { ReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';
import { slidesToElements } from './slides';
import { Slide, SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';

const slides: Record<string, SlideData> = {
  '0': { source: '# Hello, React Flow!', right: '1' },
  '1': { source: '...', left: '0', right: '2' },
  '2': { source: '...', left: '1' },
};

const nodeTypes = {
  slide: Slide,
};

const initialSlide = '0';
const { nodes, edges } = slidesToElements(initialSlide, slides);

export default export default function App() {
  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
      fitView
      fitViewOptions={{ nodes: [{ id: initialSlide }] }}
      minZoom={0.1}
    />
  );
}
```

The slides in our flow are static, so we can move the `slidesToElements` call
_outside_ the component to make sure we're not recalculating the layout if the
component re-renders. Alternatively, you could use React's `useMemo` hook to
define things inside the component but only calculate them once.

Because we have the idea of an "initial" slide now, we're also using the `fitViewOptions`
to ensure the initial slide is the one that is focused when the canvas is first
loaded.

## Navigating between slides

So far we have our presentation laid out in a grid but we have to manually pan
the canvas to see each slide, which isn't very practical for a presentation! We're
going to add three different ways to navigate between slides:

- Click-to-focus on nodes for jumping to different slides
  by clicking on them.

- Navigation buttons on each slide for moving sequentially
  between slides in any valid direction.

- Keyboard navigation using the arrow keys for moving around
  the presentation without using the mouse or interacting with a slide directly.

### Focus on click

The `<ReactFlow />` element can receive an [`onNodeClick`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-node-click)
callback that fires when _any_ node is clicked. Along with the mouse event itself,
we also receive a reference to the node that was clicked on, and we can use that
to pan the canvas thanks to the `fitView` method.

[`fitView`](/api-reference/types/react-flow-instance#fit-view) is a method on the React
Flow instance, and we can get access to it by using the [`useReactFlow`](/api-reference/types/react-flow-instance#use-react-flow)
hook.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {1-2,17-23,29}
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { ReactFlow, useReactFlow, type NodeMouseHandler } from '@xyflow/react';
import { Slide, SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';

const slides: Record<string, SlideData> = {
  ...
}

const nodeTypes = {
  slide: Slide,
};

const initialSlide = '0';
const { nodes, edges } = slidesToElements(initialSlide, slides);

export default function App() {
  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();
  const handleNodeClick = useCallback<NodeMouseHandler>(
    (_, node) => {
      fitView({ nodes: [node], duration: 150 });
    },
    [fitView],
  );

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      ...
      fitViewOptions={{ nodes: [{ id: initialSlide }] }}
      onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}
    />
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  It's important to remember to include `fitView` as in the dependency array of
  our `handleNodeClick` callback. That's because the `fitView` function is
  replaced once React Flow has initialised the viewport. If you forget this step
  you'll likely find out that `handleNodeClick` does nothing at all (and yes, we
  also forget this ourselves sometimes too <Emoji content="ð« " />
  ).
</Callout>

Calling `fitView` with no arguments would attempt to fit every node in the graph
into view, but we only want to focus on the node that was clicked! The
[`FitViewOptions`](/api-reference/types/fit-view-options) object lets us provide an
array of just the nodes we want to focus on: in this case, that's just the node
that was clicked.

    dependencies={{ 'react-remark': '2.1.0' }}
    showEditor={false}
    isTypescript
  />
</Bleed>

### Slide controls

Clicking to focus a node is handy for zooming out to see the big picture before
focusing back in on a specific slide, but it's not a very practical way for
navigating around a prsentation. In this step we'll add some controls to each
slide that allow us to move to a connected slide in any direction.

Let's add a `<footer>` to each slide that conditionally renders a button in any
direction with a connected slide. We'll also preemptively create a `moveToNextSlide`
callback that we'll use in a moment.

```tsx filename="Slide.tsx" {3,8,13-18}
import { type NodeProps, fitView } from '@xyflow/react';
import { Remark } from 'react-remark';
import { useCallback } from 'react';

...

export function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNide>) {
  const moveToNextSlide = useCallback((id: string) => {}, []);

  return (
    <article className="slide nodrag" style={style}>
      <Remark>{data.source}</Remark>
      <footer className="slide__controls nopan">
        {data.left && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.left)}>â</button>)}
        {data.up && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.up)}>â</button>)}
        {data.down && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.down)}>â</button>)}
        {data.right && (<button onClick={() => moveToNextSlide(data.right)}>â</button>)}
      </footer>
    </article>
  );
}
```

You can style the footer however you like, but it's important to add the `"nopan"`
class to prevent prevent the canvas from panning as you interact with any of the
buttons.

To implement `moveToSlide` we'll make use of `fitView` agan. Previously we had a
reference to the actual node that was clicked on to pass to `fitView`, but this
time we only have a node's id. You might be tempted to look up the target node by
its id, but actually that's not necessary! If we look at the type of
[`FitViewOptions`](/api-reference/types/fit-view-options) we can see that the array
of nodes we pass in only _needs_ to have an `id` property:

```ts filename="https://reactflow.dev/api-reference/types/fit-view-options" {7}
export type FitViewOptions = {
  padding?: number;
  includeHiddenNodes?: boolean;
  minZoom?: number;
  maxZoom?: number;
  duration?: number;
  nodes?: (Partial<Node> & { id: Node['id'] })[];
};
```

`Partial<Node>` means that all of the fields of the `Node` object type get marked
as optional, and then we intersect that with `{ id: Node['id'] }` to ensure that
the `id` field is always required. This means we can just pass in an object with
an `id` property and nothing else, and `fitView` will know what to do with it!

```tsx filename="Slide.tsx" {1,4,6-9}
import { type NodeProps, useReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';

export function Slide({ data }: NodeProps<SlideNide>) {
  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();

  const moveToNextSlide = useCallback(
    (id: string) => fitView({ nodes: [{ id }] }),
    [fitView],
  );

  return (
    <article className="slide" style={style}>
      ...
    </article>
  );
}
```

    dependencies={{ 'react-remark': '2.1.0' }}
    isTypescript
  />
</Bleed>

### Keyboard navigation

The final piece of the puzzle is to add keyboard navigation to our presentation.
It's not very convenient to have to _always_ click on a slide to move to the next
one, so we'll add some keyboard shortcuts to make it easier. React Flow lets us
listen to keyboard events on the `<ReactFlow />` component through handlers like
[`onKeyDown`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-key-down).

Up until now the slide currently focused is implied by the position of the canvas,
but if we want to handle key presses on the entire canvas we need to _explicitly_
track the current slide. We need to this because we need to know which slide to
navigate to when an arrow key is pressed!

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {1,2,13-14,17,23}
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { ReactFlow, useReactFlow } from '@xyflow/react';
import { Slide, SlideData, SLIDE_WIDTH } from './Slide';

const slides: Record<string, SlideData> = {
  ...
}

const nodeTypes = {
  slide: Slide,
};

const initialSlide = '0';
const { nodes, edges } = slidesToElements(initialSlide, slides)

export default function App() {
  const [currentSlide, setCurrentSlide] = useState(initialSlide);
  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();

  const handleNodeClick = useCallback<NodeMouseHandler>(
    (_, node) => {
      fitView({ nodes: [node] });
      setCurrentSlide(node.id);
    },
    [fitView],
  );

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      ...
      onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}
    />
  );
}
```

Here we've added a bit of state, `currentSlide`, to our flow component and we're
making sure to update it whenever a node is clicked. Next, we'll write a callback
to handle keyboard events on the canvas:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
export default function App() {
  const [currentSlide, setCurrentSlide] = useState(initialSlide);
  const { fitView } = useReactFlow();

  ...

  const handleKeyPress = useCallback<KeyboardEventHandler>(
    (event) => {
      const slide = slides[currentSlide];

      switch (event.key) {
        case 'ArrowLeft':
        case 'ArrowUp':
        case 'ArrowDown':
        case 'ArrowRight':
          const direction = event.key.slice(5).toLowerCase();
          const target = slide[direction];

          if (target) {
            event.preventDefault();
            setCurrentSlide(target);
            fitView({ nodes: [{ id: target }] });
          }
      }
    },
    [currentSlide, fitView],
  );

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      ...
      onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
    />
  );
}
```

To save some typing we're extracting the direction from the key pressed - if the
user pressed `'ArrowLeft'` we'll get `'left'` and so on. Then, if there is actually
a slide connected in that direction we'll update the current slide and call `fitView`
to navigate to it!

We're also preventing the default behaviour of the arrow keys to prevent the window
from scrolling up and down. This is necessary for this tutorial because the canvas
is only one part of the page, but for an app where the canvas is the entire
viewport you might not need to do this.

And that's everything! To recap let's look at the final result and talk about
what we've learned.

## Final thoughts

Even if you're not planning on making the next [Prezi](https://prezi.com), we've
still looked at a few useful features of React Flow in this tutorial:

- The [`useReactFlow`](/api-reference/hooks/use-react-flow) hook to access the
  `fitView` method.

- The [`onNodeClick`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-node-click) event handler to
  listen to clicks on every node in a flow.

- The [`onKeyPress`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-key-press) event handler to listen
  to keyboard events on the entire canvas.

We've also looked at how to implement a simple layouting algorithm ourselves.
Layouting is a _really_ common question we get asked about, but if your needs aren't
that complex you can get quite far rolling your own solution!

If you're looking for ideas on how to extend this project, you could try addressing
the issues we pointed out with the layouting algorithm, coming up with a more
sophisticated `Slide` component with different layouts, or something else
entirely.

You can use the completed [source code](https://github.com/xyflow/react-flow-slide-show)
as a starting point, or you can just keep building on top of what we've made today.
We'd love to see what you build so please share it with us over on our
[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RVmnytFmGW) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reactflowdev).
