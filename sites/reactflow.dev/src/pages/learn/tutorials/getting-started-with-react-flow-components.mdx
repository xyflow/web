Recently, we launched an exciting new addition to our open-source roster: React
Flow Components. These are pre-built nodes, edges, and other ui elements that you
can quickly add to your React Flow applications to get up and running. The catch
is these components are built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and
the shadcn CLI.

We've previously written about our experience and what led us to choosing shadcn
over on the [xyflow blog](https://xyflow.com/blog/react-flow-components), but in
this tutorial we're going to focus on how to get started from scratch with shadcn,
Tailwind CSS, and React Flow Components.

<Callout>
**Wait, what's shadcn?**

No what, **who**! Shadcn is the author of a collection of pre-designed components
known as `shadcn/ui`. Notice how we didn't say _library_ there? Shadcn takes a
different approach where components are added to your project's source code and
are "owned" by you: once you add a component you're free to modify it to suit your
needs!

</Callout>

## Getting started

To begin with, we'll set up a new [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev) project along with
all the dependencies and config we'll need. Start by running the following command:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx create-vite@latest
```

Vite is able to scaffold projects for many popular frameworks, but we only care
about React! Additionally, make sure to set up a **TypeScript** project. React
Flow's documentation is a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript, but for shadcn components
TypeScript is _required_!

All shadcn and React Flow components are styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first),
so we'll need to install that and a few other dependencies next:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Tailwind is a heavily customisable utility-first CSS framework and much of that
customisation is done in a `tailwind.config.js` file. Fortunately, the package
can generate a default config for us:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Tailwind works by scanning your project's source code and building a CSS file that
contains only the utilities you're using. To make sure that happens we need to
change two things:

1. Update the `content` field in `tailwind.config.js` to include any source files
   that might contain Tailwind classes.

```js filename="tailwind,config.js" {3}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

2. Replace the generated `src/index.css` file with the Tailwind directives:

```css filename="src/index.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Finally, we can go ahead and delete the generated `src/App.css` file and update
`src/App.jsx` to just render an empty `div`:

```jsx filename="src/App.jsx"
function App() {
  return <div className="w-screen h-screen p-8"></div>;
}

export default App;
```

<Callout>
  The classes `w-screen` and `h-screen` are two examples of Tailwind's utility
  classes. If you're used to styling React apps using a different approach, you
  might find this a bit strange at first. You can think of Tailwind classes as
  supercharged inline styles: they're constrained to a set design system and you
  have access to responsive media queries or pseudo-classes like `hover` and
  `focus`.
</Callout>

### Setting up shadcn/ui

Vite scaffolds some `tsconfig` files for us when generating a TypeScript project
and we'll need to make some changes to these so the shadcn components can work
correctly. The shadcn CLI is pretty clever (we'll get to that in a second) but
it can't account for every project structure so instead shadcn components that
depend on one another make use of TypeScript's import paths.

In both `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.app.json` add the following to the `compilerOptions`
object:

```json filename="tsconfig.json" {3-8}
{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

And then we need to teach Vite how to resolve these paths:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm i -D @types/node
```

```js filename="vite.config.js" {3, 7-11}
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'node:path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
```

At this point feel free to pat yourself on the back and take a tea break. There's
a lot of up-front configuration to get through but once we have the shadcn CLI
set up we'll be able to add new components to our project with a single command -
even if they have dependencies or need to modify existing files!

We can now run the following command to set up shadcn/ui in our project:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest init
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions about your project and then it will generate
a `components.json` file in the root of your project, and update your
`tailwind.config.js` with some extensions to your theme. We can take all the
default options for now:

```
âœ” Which style would you like to use? â€º New York
âœ” Which color would you like to use as the base color? â€º Neutral
âœ” Would you like to use CSS variables for theming? yes
```

## Adding your first components

To demonstrate how powerful shadcn can be, let's dive right into making a new
**React Flow** app! Now everything is set up, we can add the [`<BaseNode />`](https://reactflow.dev/components/nodes/base-node)
component with a single command:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/base-node
```

This command will generate a new file `src/components/base-node.tsx` as well as
update our dependencies to include `@xyflow/react`!

That `<BaseNode />` component is not a React Flow node directly. Instead, as the
name implies, it's a base that many of our other nodes build upon. You can use it to have a unified style for all of your nodes as well. Let's see what
it looks like by updating our `App.jsx` file:

```jsx filename="src/App.jsx" {1,3,7-11}
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';

import { BaseNode } from '@/components/base-node';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="w-screen h-screen p-8">
      <BaseNode selected={false}>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</BaseNode>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Ok, not super exciting...

<Image
  src="/img/tutorials/components/base-node.png"
  alt="A screenshot of a simple React application. It renders one element, a
  rounded container with a blue border and the text 'Hi! ðŸ‘‹' inside."
/>

Remember that the `<BaseNode />` component is used by any _other_ React Flow
components we add using the shadcn CLI, so what happens if we change it? Let's
update the `<BaseNode />` component to render any text as bold monospace instead:

```jsx filename="src/components/base-node.tsx" {11}
import React from "react";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

export const BaseNode = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> & { selected?: boolean }
>(({ className, selected, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "rounded-md border bg-card p-5 text-card-foreground font-mono font-bold",
      className,
      selected ? "border-muted-foreground shadow-lg" : "",
      "hover:ring-1",
    )}
    {...props}
  />
));
BaseNode.displayName = "BaseNode";
```

Now we'll add an actual node from the React Flow Components registry and see what
happens:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/tooltip-node
```

And we'll update our `App.tsx` file to render a proper flow. We'll use the same
basic setup as most of our examples so we won't break down the individual pieces
here. If you're still new to React Flow and want to learn a bit more about how to
set up a basic flow from scratch, check out our [quickstart guide](/learn).

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx" {14,16-18,20-33,}
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';

import {
  ReactFlow,
  OnConnect,
  Position,
  useNodesState,
  useEdgesState,
  addEdge,
  Edge,
  Node,
} from '@xyflow/react';

import { TooltipNode } from '@/components/tooltip-node';

const nodeTypes = {
  tooltip: TooltipNode,
};

const initialNodes: Node[] = [
  {
    id: '1',
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    data: {
      label: 'Hover me',
      tooltip: {
        label: 'Boo!',
        position: Position.Bottom,
      },
    },
    type: 'tooltip',
  },
];

const initialEdges: Edge[] = [];

function App() {
  const [nodes, , onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  const onConnect: OnConnect = (params) => {
    setEdges((edges) => addEdge(params, edges));
  };

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen p-8">
      <ReactFlow
        nodes={nodes}
        edges={edges}
        onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
        onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
        onConnect={onConnect}
        nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
        fitView
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

And would you look at that, the tooltip node we added automatically uses the
`<BaseNode />` component we customised!

<Bleed>
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="tutorials/components/tooltip"
    framework="react"
    showEditor={false}
  />
</Bleed>

## Moving fast and making things

Now we've got a basic understanding of how shadcn/ui and the CLI works, we can
begin to see how easy it is to add new components and build out a flow. To see
everything React Flow Components has to offer let's build out a simple calculator
flow.

First let's remove the `<TooltipNode />` and undo our changes to `<BaseNode />`.
In addition to premade nodes, React Flow Components also contains building blocks
for creating your own custom nodes. To see them, we'll add the `node-header` and
`labeled-handle` components:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add \
  https://ui.reactflow.dev/node-header \
  https://ui.reactflow.dev/labeled-handle
```

<Callout type="info">
  Notice how adding the `node-header` component also brought with it some
  standard shadcn/ui components! This lets us at React Flow build richer
  components for you to use without re-inventing the wheel for things like
  dropdowns and popovers.
</Callout>

The first node we'll create is a simple number node with some buttons to increment
and decrement the value and a handle to connect it to other nodes. Create a folder
`src/components/nodes` and then add a new file `src/components/nodes/num-node.tsx`.

Paste the following into the new file:

```tsx filename="src/components/nodes/num-node.tsx" {9-18,44-53,56,58,62,64}
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import {
  type Node,
  type NodeProps,
  Position,
  useReactFlow,
} from '@xyflow/react';

import { BaseNode } from '@/components/base-node';
import { LabeledHandle } from '@/components/labeled-handle';
import {
  NodeHeader,
  NodeHeaderTitle,
  NodeHeaderActions,
  NodeHeaderMenuAction,
} from '@/components/node-header';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { DropdownMenuItem } from '@/components/ui/dropdown-menu';

export type NumNode = Node<{
  value: number;
}>;

export function NumNode({ id, data }: NodeProps<NumNode>) {
  const { updateNodeData, setNodes } = useReactFlow();

  const handleReset = useCallback(() => {
    updateNodeData(id, { value: 0 });
  }, [id, updateNodeData]);

  const handleDelete = useCallback(() => {
    setNodes((nodes) => nodes.filter((node) => node.id !== id));
  }, [id, setNodes]);

  const handleIncr = useCallback(() => {
    updateNodeData(id, { value: data.value + 1 });
  }, [id, data.value, updateNodeData]);

  const handleDecr = useCallback(() => {
    updateNodeData(id, { value: data.value - 1 });
  }, [id, data.value, updateNodeData]);

  return (
    <BaseNode>
      <NodeHeader>
        <NodeHeaderTitle>Num</NodeHeaderTitle>
        <NodeHeaderActions>
          <NodeHeaderMenuAction label="Open node menu">
            <DropdownMenuItem onSelect={handleReset}>Reset</DropdownMenuItem>
            <DropdownMenuItem onSelect={handleDelete}>Delete</DropdownMenuItem>
          </NodeHeaderMenuAction>
        </NodeHeaderActions>
      </NodeHeader>

      <div className="flex gap-2 items-center mb-10">
        <Button onClick={handleDecr}>-</Button>
        <pre>{String(data.value).padStart(3, ' ')}</pre>
        <Button onClick={handleIncr}>+</Button>
      </div>

      <footer className="bg-gray-100 -m-5">
        <LabeledHandle title="out" type="source" position={Position.Right} />
      </footer>
    </BaseNode>
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  This isn't a tutorial for basic React Flow concepts like flows and custom
  nodes so we're **skipping over some of the basics**. If you're new to React
  Flow and want to learn how to add custom nodes and edges to a flow, check out
  the [guide on custom nodes](/learn/customization/custom-nodes).
</Callout>

In the snippet above we've highligted the imports and components that come from
shadcn/ui and React Flow Components. In just a few lines of code we already have
quite a capable node:

<Bleed>
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="tutorials/components/num-node"
    framework="react"
    showEditor={false}
  />
</Bleed>

Our `<NumNode />` component...

- Has a header with a title and functional dropdown menu.
- Contains some simple controls to increment and decrement a value.
- Has a labelled handle to connect it to other nodes.

Next we'll create a second node that will compute the sum of two input values.
We don't need to add any additional components for this node, so go ahead and
create a new file `src/components/nodes/sum-node.tsx` and paste in the following:

```tsx filename="src/components/nodes/sum-node.tsx"
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import {
  type Node,
  type NodeProps,
  Position,
  useReactFlow,
  useStore,
} from '@xyflow/react';

import { BaseNode } from '../base-node';
import { LabeledHandle } from '../labeled-handle';
import { NodeHeader, NodeHeaderTitle } from '../node-header';

export type SumNode = Node<{
  value: number;
}>;

export function SumNode({ id }: NodeProps<SumNode>) {
  const { updateNodeData, getHandleConnections } = useReactFlow();
  const { x, y } = useStore((state) => ({
    x: getHandleValue(
      getHandleConnections({ nodeId: id, id: 'x', type: 'target' }),
      state.nodeLookup,
    ),
    y: getHandleValue(
      getHandleConnections({ nodeId: id, id: 'y', type: 'target' }),
      state.nodeLookup,
    ),
  }));

  useEffect(() => {
    updateNodeData(id, { value: x + y });
  }, [x, y]);

  return (
    <BaseNode className="w-32">
      <NodeHeader>
        <NodeHeaderTitle>Sum</NodeHeaderTitle>
      </NodeHeader>

      <footer className="bg-gray-100 -m-5">
        <LabeledHandle
          title="x"
          id="x"
          type="target"
          position={Position.Left}
        />
        <LabeledHandle
          title="y"
          id="y"
          type="target"
          position={Position.Left}
        />
        <LabeledHandle title="out" type="source" position={Position.Right} />
      </footer>
    </BaseNode>
  );
}

function getHandleValue(
  connections: Array<{ source: string }>,
  lookup: Map<string, Node<any>>,
) {
  return connections.reduce((acc, { source }) => {
    const node = lookup.get(source)!;
    const value = node.data.value;

    return typeof value === 'number' ? acc + value : acc;
  }, 0);
}
```

React Flow Components doesn't just provide components for building nodes. We also
provide pre-built edges and other UI elements you can drop into your flows for
quick building.

To better visualise data in our calculator flow, let's pull in the `data-edge`
component. This edge renders a field from the source node's data object as a label
on the edge itself. Add the `data-edge` component to your project:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/data-edge
```

The `<DataEdge />` component works by looking up a field from its source node's
`data` object. We've been storing the value of each node in our calculator field
in a `"value"` property so we'll update our `edgeType` object to include the new
`data-edge` and we'll update the `onConnect` handler to create a new edge of this
type, making sure to set the edge's `data` object correctly:

```tsx
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';

import {
  ReactFlow,
  OnConnect,
  Position,
  useNodesState,
  useEdgesState,
  addEdge,
  Edge,
  Node,
} from '@xyflow/react';

import { NumNode } from '@/components/nodes/num-node';
import { SumNode } from '@/components/nodes/sum-node';

import { DataEdge } from '@/components/data-edge';

const nodeTypes = {
  num: NumNode,
  sum: SumNode,
};

const initialNodes: Node[] = [
  { id: 'a', type: 'num', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 0, y: 0 } },
  { id: 'b', type: 'num', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 0, y: 200 } },
  { id: 'c', type: 'sum', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 300, y: 100 } },
  { id: 'd', type: 'num', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 0, y: 400 } },
  { id: 'e', type: 'sum', data: { value: 0 }, position: { x: 600, y: 400 } },
];

const edgeTypes = {
  data: DataEdge,
};

const initialEdges: Edge[] = [
  {
    id: 'a->c',
    type: 'data',
    data: { key: 'value' },
    source: 'a',
    target: 'c',
    targetHandle: 'x',
  },
  {
    id: 'b->c',
    type: 'data',
    data: { key: 'value' },
    source: 'b',
    target: 'c',
    targetHandle: 'y',
  },
  {
    id: 'c->e',
    type: 'data',
    data: { key: 'value' },
    source: 'c',
    target: 'e',
    targetHandle: 'x',
  },
  {
    id: 'd->e',
    type: 'data',
    data: { key: 'value' },
    source: 'd',
    target: 'e',
    targetHandle: 'y',
  },
];

function App() {
  const [nodes, , onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  const onConnect: OnConnect = useCallback(
    (params) => {
      setEdges((edges) =>
        addEdge({ type: 'data', data: { key: 'value' }, ...params }, edges),
      );
    },
    [setEdges],
  );

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen p-8">
      <ReactFlow
        nodes={nodes}
        edges={edges}
        onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
        onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
        onConnect={onConnect}
        nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
        edgeTypes={edgeTypes}
        fitView
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Putting everything together we end up with quite a capable little calculator!

You could continue to improve this flow by adding nodes to perform other operations
or to take user input using additional components from the [shadcn/ui registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/slider).
In fact, keep your eyes peeled soon for a follow-up to this guide where we'll show
a complete application built using React Flow Components <Emoji content="ðŸ‘€" />.

## Wrapping up

In just a short amount of time we've managed to build out a fairly complete flow
using the components and building blocks provided by shadcn React Flow Components.
We've learned:

- How editing the [`<BaseNode />`](/components/nodes/base-node) component will
  affect other nodes pulled from the React Flow Components registry.

- How to use building blocks like the [`<NodeHeader />`](/components/node-blocks/node-header)
  and [`<LabeledHandle />`](components/handles/labeled-handle) components to build
  our own custom nodes without starting from scratch.

- That React Flow Components also provides custom edges like the [`<DataEdge />`](/components/edges/data-edge)
  to drop into our applications.

And thanks to the power of Tailwind, tweaking the visual style of these components
is as simple as editing `tailwind.config.js` and editing the variables in your CSS
file.

That's all for now! You can see all the components we currently have available over
on the [components docs page](/components). The React Flow Components project is
still in its infancy: if you have any suggestions or requests for new components
we'd love to hear about them. Or perhaps you're already starting to build something
with shadcn and React Flow Components. Either way make sure you let us know on our
[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RVmnytFmGW) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xyflowdev)!
