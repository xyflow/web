import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared';
import { ExampleLayout } from 'xy-shared';

import { getStaticCode } from 'xy-shared/server';
export const getStaticProps = getStaticCode(['examples/layout/elkjs']);


<ExampleLayout>
Like our [dagre example](/examples/layout/dagre), this example shows how you can integrate [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) with React Flow for more advanced tree layouts. The code for this example builds a similar tree to the dagre example, but you can look at the reference [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html) to see what you can configure (hint: it's a lot).

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/layout/elkjs" framework="react" />
