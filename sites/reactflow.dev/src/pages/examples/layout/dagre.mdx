import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example-with-frontmatter';

<ExampleLayout>
This example shows how you can integrate [dagre.js](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) with React Flow to create simple tree layouts. Good alternatives to dagre are [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy) or [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) if you are looking for a more advanced layouting library.

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/DagreTree"
  additionalFiles={['nodes-edges.js']}
  dependencies={{ dagre: 'latest' }}
/>
</ExampleLayout>
