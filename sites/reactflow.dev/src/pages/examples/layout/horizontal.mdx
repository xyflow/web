<ExampleLayout>
A diagram can go from left to right or from top to bottom, but you can also create mixed ones.
For controlling the direction of a diagram you can adjust the handle positions of a node with the [`sourcePosition` and `targetPosition`](/api-reference/types/node) props.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/layout/horizontal" framework="react" />

</ExampleLayout>
