<ExampleLayout>
A Connection Line is what you see when you click and drag out from a handle. It represents a possible edge and can snap to valid handles in close proximity.
You can implement your own Connection Line by passing a React component rendering the line. You can find the passed props in the [custom connection line docs](/api-reference/types/connection-line-component-props).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/edges/custom-connectionline"
  framework="react"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
