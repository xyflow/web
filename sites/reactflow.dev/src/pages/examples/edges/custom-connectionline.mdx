<ExampleLayout>
A Connection Line is what you see when you click and drag out from a handle. It represents a possible edge and can snap to valid handles in close proximity.
You can implement your own Connection Line by passing a React component rendering the line. You can find the passed props in the [custom connection line docs](/api-reference/types/connection-line-component-props).

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/CustomConnectionLine"
  additionalFiles={['ConnectionLine.js', 'CustomNode.js']}
/>
</ExampleLayout>
