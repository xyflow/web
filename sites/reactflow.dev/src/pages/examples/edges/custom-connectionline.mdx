<ExampleLayout>
A Connection Line is what you see when you click and drag out from a handle. It represents a possible edge and can snap to valid handles in close proximity.
You can implement your own Connection Line by passing a React component rendering the line. You can find the passed props in the [custom connection line docs](/api-reference/types/connection-line-component-props).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/examples/edges/custom-connectionline/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/examples/edges/custom-connectionline/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
