<ExampleLayout>
React Flow has built-in support for different marker types for your edges. It's possible to add your own [SVG markers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker), too.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/examples/edges/markers/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/examples/edges/markers/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
