In React Flow, almost everything is built around the concepts of nodes and edges.
Edges are the connections between nodes, but what if we want to create an edge
that is only connected to one node? What about an "edge" not connected to any
nodes at all?

This example shows how to create an "incomplete" edge when a user releases a
connection line without making a connection. A ghost node is rendered where the
connection line was released, and a temporary edge is added to the flow. Making
use of editable edges, the user can pick the edge back up and complete the
connection at which point the ghost node is removed!

<Callout type="info">
  Instead of connecting `A` directly to `B` in the flow, try releasing the
  connection line in an empty space to create a temporary edge!
</Callout>

We've defined a `useIncompleteEdge` hook that encapsulates the logic for creating
and managing a "ghost node". It returns a number of event handlers intended to be
passed to the `<ReactFlow />` component.

- [`onConnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect) is called when a complete
  connection is made.

- [`onConnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect-end) is called when the
  user releases a connection line. The seconed `connectionState` param can be used
  to determine if the connection was successful or not and where it started
  (and ended if the connection is valid). This callback creates a ghost node and a
  temporary edge from the `connectionState.fromNode.id` to that ghost node. The temporary
  edge is marked as `reconnectable` so that the user can pick it back up and
  complete the connection.

- [`onReconnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-reconnect) is called when a complete
  reconnection is made.

- [`onReconnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-reconnect-start) is called when
  the user releases a reconnection line. This callback removes the ghost node and
  temporary edge. A new one may be added back when `onConnectEnd` is called.
