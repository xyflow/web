React Flow comes with four different edge types - `default` (bezier), `straight`, `step` and `smoothstep`. It's also possible to create a [custom edge](/api-reference/types/edge-props), if you need special edge routing or controls at the edge. In this example we are demonstrating how to implement an edge with a button, a bi-directional edge, a self connecting edge. In all examples we are using the [BaseEdge](/api-reference/components/base-edge) component as a helper.

    'ButtonEdge.tsx',
    'SelfConnectingEdge.tsx',
    'BiDirectionalEdge.tsx',
    'BiDirectionalNode.tsx',
    'buttonedge.css',
  ]}
  activeFile="ButtonEdge.tsx"
  isTypescript
/>
