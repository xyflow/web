<ExampleLayout>
A drag and drop user interface is very common for node-based workflow editors. The drag and drop behaviour outside of the React Flow pane is not built in but can be implemented with the native [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) (used in this example) or a third party library like [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable).

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/interaction/drag-and-drop/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/interaction/drag-and-drop/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

</ExampleLayout>
