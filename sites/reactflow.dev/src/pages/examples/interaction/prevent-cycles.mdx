<ExampleLayout>

In the [validation](/examples/interaction/validation) example, we saw how to use
the [`isValidConnection`](/api-reference/react-flow#is-valid-connection) callback
to prevent certain connections from being created. This example shows how to use
the [`getOutgoers`](/api-reference/utils/get-outgoers) util to check if a new
connection would cause a cycle in the flow.
