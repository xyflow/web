  React Flow emits different events during the connection process. Use this example
  to get an overview of those events and what order they are called in.

<ExampleLayout>
React Flow emits different events during the connection process that you can use
to update your UI or your flow in different ways. The example below demonstrates
which events are fired and when.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/interaction/connection-events"
  framework="react"
/>

For a **new connection** created by dragging from a handle, the following events
are called in order:

- [`onConnectStart`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect-start) is called with
  the mouse event and an object containing the source node, potentially the source
  handle id, and the handle type.

- [`onConnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect) is only called when the
  connection is released on a handle that [is connectable](/api-reference/components/handle#is-connectable).
  It is called with a complete [connection object](/api-reference/types/connection)
  containing the source and target node, and the source and target handle ids if
  present.

- [`onConnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect-end) is called when a
  connection is released, regardless of whether it was successful or not. It is
  called with the mouse event.

When an edge is **reconnected** by dragging an existing edge, the following events
are called in order:

- [`onReconnectStart`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-reconnect-start) is called when
  a [reconnectable edge](/api-reference/types/edge#reconnectable) is picked up.
  It is called with the mouse event, the edge object that is being reconnected,
  and the type of the stable handle.

- [`onConnectStart`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect-start) is called as
  above.

- [`onReconnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-reconnect) is called when the edge
  is released on a handle that is [reconnectable](/api-reference/types/edge#reconnectable).
  It is called with the old [edge object](/api-reference/types/edge) and the new
  [connection object](/api-reference/types/connection).

- [`onConnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-connect-end) is called as above.

- [`onReconnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-reconnect-end) is called when
  the edge is released, regardless of whether the reconnection whas successful or
  not. It is called with the mouse event, the edge that was picked up, and the
  type of the stable handle.

<Callout type="info">
  You can see many of these events in use in our [add node on edge
  drop](/examples/nodes/add-node-on-edge-drop) and [temporary
  edges](/examples/edges/temporary-edges) examples!
</Callout>
