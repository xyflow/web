<ExampleLayout>
In this example we are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling the flow.

<Callout type="warning">
  We are using the Tailwind CDN for this example. Because of a [bug](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/issues/624)
  with SandPack, opening the sandbox below will not have the script added to the
  HTML document. To make sure the example works correctly, make sure you add
  `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` to the HTML document
  in `public/index.html` manually.

If you are copying the example locally, you will likely have Tailwind set up
differently, and can ignore this warning.

</Callout>

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/Tailwind"
  additionalFiles={['CustomNode.js', 'tailwind-config.js']}
  activeFile="CustomNode.js"
  sandpackOptions={{
    externalResources: ['https://cdn.tailwindcss.com'],
  }}
/>
