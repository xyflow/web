title: Updating Nodes
description: This example shows how to update the data field of a specific node. You need to create a new data object and always pass the newly created nodes array to the ReactFlow component.

import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example-with-frontmatter';
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<ExampleLayout>
You can update properties of nodes and edges freely as long as you pass a newly created `nodes` or `edges` array to `ReactFlow`.

{' '}

<Callout type="info">
  You have to create a new `data` object on a node to notify React Flow about
  data changes.
</Callout>
