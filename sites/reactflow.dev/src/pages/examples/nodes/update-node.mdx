title: Updating Nodes
description: This example shows how to update the data field of a specific node. You need to create a new data object and always pass the newly created nodes array to the ReactFlow component.
---

import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import { ExampleLayout } from 'xy-ui';

<ExampleLayout>
You can update properties of nodes and edges freely as long as you pass a newly created `nodes` or `edges` array to `ReactFlow`.

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/UpdateNode"
  additionalFiles={['updatenode.css']}
/>
</ExampleLayout>
