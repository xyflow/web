title: Custom Nodes
description: This is an example of a custom node implementation. React Flow nodes are React components, and you can display any content that you want.
---

import ExampleViewer from '@/components/example-viewer';
import ExampleLayout from '@/layouts/example-with-frontmatter';

<ExampleLayout>
Creating your own nodes is as easy as creating a regular React component and passing them to `nodeTypes`. Being just regular components, you can essentially display any content and implement any functionality you like. Inside, you have access to a number of props that let you implement and extend default node behaviour.

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/CustomNode"
  additionalFiles={['ColorSelectorNode.js', 'index.css']}
/>
</ExampleLayout>
