<ExampleLayout>
For many types of applications, having a toolbar or set of controls appear when
a node is selected can be quite useful. It's so useful, in fact, that we've built
the [`<NodeToolbar />`](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar) component to make
it easy to add this functionality to your custom nodes!

<Callout type="info">
  Content in the toolbar is not scaled as you zoom your flow in and out: this
  means it should always be visible.
</Callout>

<RemoteCodeViewer
  source={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/nodes/node-toolbar/source.json`}
  preview={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EXAMPLES_URL}/react/examples/nodes/node-toolbar/index.html`}
  framework="react"
/>

For more information on the `<NodeToolbar />` component and its props, check out
the [API reference](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar).

</ExampleLayout>
