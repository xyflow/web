This pro example is deprecated as resizing of nodes is now supported through the [NodeResizer package](/api-reference/components/node-resizer). Please refer to the [Node Resizer](/examples/nodes/node-resizer) and [Resize and Rotate](/examples/nodes/resize-rotate) examples for more details.

</Callout>

This example shows how to implement a [custom node](/learn/customization/custom-nodes) that can be resized and rotated using [moveable](https://daybrush.com/moveable/). It can be used as a starting point for building flow chart editors or diagrams where users can configure the size and rotation of the elements.

Dependencies: [reactflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactflow), [moveable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moveable)
