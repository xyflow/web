<ExampleLayout>
A full-stack app that statically renders a flow with React Flow on the server. It is composed of a small [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server and a simple React frontend. Edit the displayed nodes and edges, adjust the export format, aspect ratio, and output dimensions. When you make changes, a request is sent to the server, which responds with a downloadable HTML preview or an image.
