title: Theming
description: React Flow comes with a minimal default theme. It's common to overwrite the default styles with your own CSS or use third-party libraries like TailwindCSS or Styled Components.

# Theming

React Flow has been built with deep customization in mind. Many of our users
fully transform the look and feel of React Flow to match their own brand or design
system. This guide will introduce you to the different ways you can customize
React Flow's appearance.

## Default styles

React Flow's default styles are enough to get going with the built-in nodes. They
provide some sensible defaults for styles like padding, border radius, and animated
edges. You can see what they look like below:

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/DefaultStyle"
  showEditor={false}
  options={{ wrapContent: true }}
/>

You'll typically load these default styles by importing them in you `App.jsx`
file or other entry point:

```js
import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';
```

Without dipping into [custom nodes](../../examples/nodes/custom-node) and
[edges](../../examples/edges/custom-edges), there are three ways you can style
React Flow's basic look:

- Passing inline styles through `style` props
- Overriding the built-in classes with custom CSS
- Overriding the CSS variables React Flow uses

### Customizing with `style` props

The easiest way to start customising the look and feel of your flows is to use
the `style` prop found on many of React Flow's components to inline your own
CSS.

```jsx
import ReactFlow from '@xyflow/react'

const styles = {
  background: 'red',
  width: '100%',
  height: 300,
};

export default function Flow() {
  return <ReactFlow style={styles} nodes={[...]} edges={[...]} />
}
```

### Overriding built-in classes

Some consider heavy use of inline styles to be an anti-pattern. In that case,
you can override the built-in classes that React Flow uses with your own CSS.
There are many classes attached to all sorts of elements in React Flow, but the
ones you'll likely want to override are listed below:

| Class name                         | Description                                                                         |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.react-flow`                      | The outermost container                                                             |
| `.react-flow__renderer`            | The inner container                                                                 |
| `.react-flow__zoompane`            | Zoom & pan pane                                                                     |

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful if you go poking around the source code looking for other classes
  to override. Some classes are used internally and are required in order for
  the library to be functional. If you replace them you may end up with
  unexpected bugs or errors!
</Callout>

### CSS variables

If you don't want to replace the default styles entirely but just want to tweak
the overall look and feel, you can override some of the CSS variables we use
throughout the library.

These variables are mostly self-explanatory. Below is a table of all the variables
you might want to tweak and their default values for reference:

| Variable name                                      | Default                             |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `--edge-stroke-default`                            | `#b1b1b7`                           |
| `--edge-stroke-width-default`                      | `1`                                 |
| `--edge-stroke-selected-default`                   | `#555`                              |
| `--connectionline-stroke-default`                  | `#b1b1b7`                           |

| `--node-color-default`                             | `inherit`                           |
| `--node-border-default`                            | `1px solid #1a192b`                 |
| `--node-background-color-default`                  | `#fff`                              |
| `--node-group-background-color-default`            | `rgba(240, 240, 240, 0.25)`         |

| `--node-boxshadow-selected-default`                | `0 0 0 0.5px #1a192b`               |
| `--handle-background-color-default`                | `#1a192b`                           |
| `--handle-border-color-default`                    | `#fff`                              |
| `--selection-background-color-default`             | `rgba(0, 89, 220, 0.08)`            |
| `--selection-border-default`                       | `1px dotted rgba(0, 89, 220, 0.8)`  |
| `--controls-button-background-color-default`       | `#fefefe`                           |
| `--controls-button-background-color-hover-default` | `#f4f4f4`                           |
| `--controls-button-color-default`                  | `inherit`                           |
| `--controls-button-color-hover-default`            | `inherit`                           |
| `--controls-button-border-color-default`           | `#eee`                              |
| `--controls-box-shadow-default`                    | `0 0 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`   |

These variables are used to define the _defaults_ for the various elements of
React Flow. This means they can still be overriden by inline styles or custom
classes on a per-element basis.

## Third-party solutions

You can choose to opt-out of React Flow's default styling altogether and use a
third-party styling solution instead. If you want to do this, you must make sure
you still import the base styles.

```js
import 'reactflow/dist/base.css';
```

<Callout type="warning">
  These base styles are **required** for React Flow to function correctly. If
  you don't import them or you override them with your own styles, some things
  might not work as expected!
</Callout>

<ExampleViewer
  codePath="example-flows/BaseStyle"
  showEditor={false}
  options={{ editorHeight: 500, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }}
/>

### Styled Components

Many of the components you render directly, such as the
[`<MiniMap />`](../../api/components/MiniMap), accept both `className` and
`style` props. This means you can use any styling solution you like, such as
[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/):

```jsx
import { MiniMap } from '@xyflow/react';

const StyledMiniMap = styled(MiniMap)`
  background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.bg};

  .react-flow__minimap-mask {
    fill: ${(props) => props.theme.minimapMaskBg};
  }

  .react-flow__minimap-node {
    fill: ${(props) => props.theme.nodeBg};
    stroke: none;
  }
`;
```

### TailwindCSS

Custom nodes and edges are just React components, and you can use any styling
solution you'd like to style them. For example, you might want to use
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style your nodes:

```jsx
function CustomNode({ data }) {
  return (
    <div className="px-4 py-2 shadow-md rounded-md bg-white border-2 border-stone-400">
      <div className="flex">
        <div className="rounded-full w-12 h-12 flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-100">
          {data.emoji}
        </div>
        <div className="ml-2">
          <div className="text-lg font-bold">{data.name}</div>
          <div className="text-gray-500">{data.job}</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <Handle
        type="target"
        position={Position.Top}
        className="w-16 !bg-teal-500"
      />
      <Handle
        type="source"
        position={Position.Bottom}
        className="w-16 !bg-teal-500"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
