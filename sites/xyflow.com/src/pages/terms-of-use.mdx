- (4) The contract language is English, all declarations and communication shall take place in English language.

### 17. Miscellaneous

- (4) Should individual provisions of the Service Agreement, these Terms of Use or of contracts or agreements concluded between the Parties be fully or partially invalid or unenforceable or become invalid or unenforceable after the conclusion of the respective contract, this shall not affect the validity of the other provisions. Instead, the Parties shall endeavour to agree a substitute regulation that comes as close as possible to the effects of the invalid or unenforceable regulation in a legally permissible and economic way. The aforesaid provisions shall also apply in case regulations should turn out to have gaps.
