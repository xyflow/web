<BlogPostLayout>

For the last few months we‚Äôve been wrapping up a solid React Flow 12 release for y‚Äôall. Since the last major release, we‚Äôve grown our core team to five people, reached more than 22k stars on Github, rebranded to xyflow, launched Svelte Flow (many great side-effects of this are baked into this release), and kept all of our office plants alive.

This release also brings the final piece of the ‚Äúxyflow‚Äù puzzle, as our package name changes from `reactflow` to `@xyflow/react`. We pinky promise that we won‚Äôt change our package name again anytime soon!

React Flow 12 has been in beta since January and we‚Äôve been tending to bugs since then, so we‚Äôre confident in sending this out now as a stable release. Shout-out to the brave souls who have already tried it out and submitted your issues, we appreciate you! üôèüèª

If you want to skip the details and just migrate your project, head over to our [migration guide](https://reactflow.dev/learn/troubleshooting/migrate-to-v12).

### TL;DR

<div style={{ marginTop: -10 }} />

React Flow 12 is here, and the main features are

<div style={{ marginTop: -10 }} />

- Server side rendering support
- Hooks and helpers for computing flows
- Dark mode
- Better DX via TSDoc

# Major features

<div style={{ marginTop: -30 }} />

## 1. Support for server side rendering

<Bleed>
  <SSRFlow />
</Bleed>

<div className="text-center text-gray-500 mt-1">
  This flow was rendered on the server. It can be displayed without Javascript
  on the client.
</div>

React is heading towards server side rendering, with tools like [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and [waku](https://waku.gg/). We‚Äôve gotten asked to support server side rendering more than a [couple](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/issues/3168) of [times](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/issues/3384) due to difficulties using React Flow with these tools. In React Flow 11, Astro just renders a blank screen by default when using React Flow- that‚Äôs no good.

With React Flow 12, you can now:

- Display static HTML diagrams for docs sites (even if the client has no JS)
- Dynamically generate opengraph images that appear as embeds when sharing a link to your flow
- Pre-render flows for crawlable content

## 2. Computing flows - hooks and helpers

<Bleed>
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="learn/computing-6"
    showEditor={false}
    framework="react"
  />
</Bleed>

One of the most difficult things about using React Flow is managing state and data flow, even though it‚Äôs really a general difficulty with React.

In the new release we added helpers to simplify getting data from connected nodes, updating node data, and managing the data between nodes. It‚Äôs nothing like fully-fledged state management but we are sure this can help folks who just need to do some simple data processing on the client-side to get up-and-running faster with their React Flow apps.

## 3. Dark mode

<Bleed>
  <RemoteCodeViewer
    route="examples/styling/dark-mode"
    showEditor={false}
    framework="react"
  />
</Bleed>

React Flow finally comes with a built-in dark mode üåö We added a `colorMode` prop, where you can toggle between "light", "dark", or "system". Under the hood, React Flow just adds a class name to the wrapper, but we had to do a bunch of changes to make this possible. Now all of the default styles are using CSS variables, so you can easily build your own themes based on that.

Check out the [dark mode example](https://reactflow.dev/examples/styling/dark-mode/)

## 4. Better Dev Experience with TSDoc

<Bleed>
  <Image
    src="/img/blog/v12/tsdoc.gif"
    alt="IDE hover information for nodes prop, there is more information shown in React Flow 12 than in React Flow 11"
    width={907}
    height={720}
/>

</Bleed>

We now use TSDoc to create a better dev experience in your IDE to get more info about what a function or component does. We‚Äôve been told our DX is pretty good already, but we‚Äôre always happy to make it even better üíÖüèª

**Bonus feature: Performance improvements**

We worked with [Ivan Akulov](https://3perf.com/) to improve the performance of React Flow, and we received some beautiful, detailed, well-explained PRs, and each one has made an impact on this release. We highly recommend taking a peek at some of Ivan's work:

- [Add performance tests for selecting, dragging, and remounting](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/3685)
- [Initial costs: Batch initial store updates together + more](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/3677)
- [Don‚Äôt rerender NodeRenderer and MiniMapNodes unless necessary](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/pull/3668)

# Even more features!

Besides the new main features listed above, we added some other things that we wanted to include for a long time.

- **[`useConnection` hook](/api-reference/hooks/use-connection):** With this hook you can access the ongoing connection. For example, you can use it for colorizing handles styling a custom connection line based on the current start / end handles.
- **Controlled `viewport`:** This is an advanced feature. Possible use cases are to animate the viewport or round the transform for lower res screens for example. This features brings two new props: [`viewport`](/api-reference/react-flow#viewport) and [`onViewportChange`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-viewport-change).
- **[`ViewportPortal`](/api-reference/components/viewport-portal) component:** This makes it possible to render elements in the viewport without the need to implement a custom node.
- **[`onDelete`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-delete) handler**: We added a combined handler for `onDeleteNodes` and `onDeleteEdges` to make it easier to react to deletions.
- **[`onBeforeDelete`](/api-reference/react-flow#on-before-delete) handler**: With this handler you can prevent/ manage deletions.
- **[`isValidConnection`](/api-reference/react-flow#is-valid-connection) prop:** This makes it possible to implement one validation function for all connections. It also gets called for programmatically added edges.
- **[`autoPanSpeed`](/api-reference/react-flow#autoPanSpeed) prop:** For controlling the speed while auto panning.
- **[`paneClickDistance`](/api-reference/react-flow#paneClickDistance) prop:** max distance between mousedown/up that will trigger a click.
- **Background component**: add [`patternClassName`](/api-reference/components/background#pattern-class-name) prop to be able to style the background pattern by using a class name. This is useful if you want to style the background pattern with Tailwind for example.
- **Node Resizer updates**: child nodes don't move when the group is resized, extent and expand is recognized correctly
- **`onMove` callback** gets triggered for library-invoked viewport updates (like fitView or zoom-in)
- **`deleteElements`** now returns deleted nodes and deleted edges
- add **`origin` attribute** for nodes
- add **`selectable` attribute** for edges
- Correct types for `BezierEdge`, `StepEdge`, `SmoothStepEdge` and `StraightEdge` components
- New edges created by the library only have `sourceHandle` and `targetHandle` attributes when those attributes are set. (We used to pass `sourceHandle: null` and `targetHandle: null`)
- Edges do not mount/unmount when their z-index change
- connection line knows about the target handle position so that the path is drawn correctly
- `nodeDragThreshold` is 1 by default instead of 0
- a better selection box usability (capture while dragging out of the flow)
- add `selectable`, `deletable`, `draggable` and `parentId` to `NodeProps`
- add a warning when styles not loaded

# And that's it!

That's all for this release, thanks for sticking around and using React Flow üòäüåª If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out on discord, github, or our [contact form](/contact).
