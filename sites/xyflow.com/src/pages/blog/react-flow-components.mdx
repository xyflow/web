At xyflow we try to pay close attention to the developer experience when using
our libraries or our docs: we have a huge collection of examples, tutorials that
walk you through development from scratch, and [starter apps on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-flow-starter-ts-r69228)
This great experience starts to fall away once you move to your own apps, though.

Our users have always been excited to show us what they've been building, and over
time we noticed that many React Flow projects are defining similar components in
their flows. This got us thinking: how can we cut down on all the duplicated work
folks are doing and make it easier for our users to hit the ground running?

## The initial idea: a ui library for React Flow

Our first instinct was to build a companion ui package that provides some pre-built
nodes and edges. We had some experience with this in the past, our node resizer
component started as a separate package before being brought into the core library.

On the surface this suonds like a great idea, but after a bit of thinking we
realised there was a big downside to taking this approach. Compared to similar
libraries, React Flow is designed to be fairly low-level and with a high amount of
customisability. How would users customise and style components hidden away inside
a library?

After some consideration, we decided this approach wasn't going to work for us
for a few reasons:

- It would be too complicated to build the things we wanted to build while also
  also making the components flexible enough to be styled or used in different
  applications.

- If users needed features we didn't anticipate they would have to fork the
  library and add it themselves; negating a lot of the benefits of us developing
  a library in the first place.

- We didn't want work on issues and feature requests to distract us from working
  on the React Flow library itself.

## Shadcn and a new approach to component libraries

Shadcn is a component "library" that has been steadily gaining hype and adoption
for some time now. The premise is simple: instead of providing an opaque package
of components, shadcn provides the source code for each component and expects you
to vendor the code into your own projects. It harkens back to the days before
npm and bundlers and honestly it can feel quite nice; when we rebuilt our docs
site we lent heavily into shadcn for many of our ui components.

This approach felt like it solved a lot of the problems we had with publishing
a standalone package, and so at the beginning of the year a handful of us got to
work trying to build a collection of components and code snippets that folks could
vendor into their own projects.

We spent a while developping this but eventually decided to shelf the project
after we were disastified with some of the compromises we ended up making along
the way.

The biggest open-ended question we kept running into was what to do about _styling_.
On the one hand we wanted to provide components that were easy to use and looked
good out of the box, but on the other hand we couldn't make any assumptions about
what styling approach folks would be taking and we couldn't easily pull in external
dependencies without making the installation process confusing.

Although we had benched the idea, it was a frequent topic of conversation in our
team meetings. We knew the value of shipping _something_ would be high, we just
couldn't work out _how_...

## A new hope: the shadcn CLI

Shadcn has had a simple CLI to install their components into your codebase for
a while now, but more recently the CLI was given the ability to install _external_
components as long as they followed a simple JSON schema.

This solved a bunch of problems for us:

- All shadcn components use Tailwind CSS, so we can add styles to our components
  without needing to worry about the user installing additional dependencies.

- Shadcn components can depend on _other shadcn components_, so we can build out
  more sophisticated components that take advantage on the great collection of
  shadcn components that already exist.

- These components are vendored into the user's codebase meaning we don't need to
  worry about covering every single use case or feature request: folks can implement
  what they need!

## Introducing React Flow Components

This was the kick we needed to jump into the project again. We've been working
hard to build out a collection of initial components that we think will make it
easier for folks to put together React Flow projects going forward. Some interesting
components from the initial set include:

- A database schema node that makes it easy to visualise tables and relationships
  between columns.

- A zoom slider for more convenient control over the viewport zoom level.

- Debugging components that make it easier to inspect a node's properties and the
  state of your flow.

We've also laid the foundation to build out more advanced components in the future.
We're still not sure if this is something we're going to commit to, so please try
out the components and let us know what you think! You can find the documentation
for these components and a brief guide on how to install them by heading over to
[reactflow.dev/components](https://reactflow.dev/components), or you can learn
more about shadcn and the CLI [over on their docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

We're excited to see what you build with these components, and we're looking
forward to hearing your feedback! Please open issues on our [web repo](https://github.com/xyflow/web/issues)
if you run into any problems or have any suggestions for new components, and definitely
tweet at us at [@xyflowdev](https://x.com/xyflowdev) if you build something cool
with them!
