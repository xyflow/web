<BlogPostLayout>
Today we are excited to launch Svelte Flow! üéâ‚ö°Ô∏è Svelte Flow is a library for creating workflow builders, database visualizers, data processing tools, and anything else you can imagine with nodes on a screen.

Try it out with `npm install @xyflow/svelte`, or check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow). Svelte Flow is MIT Licensed and was built from the ground-up by the team who created and maintains [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/).

üïπ **Interactivity out-of-the-box:** dragging nodes, zooming, panning, selecting multiple nodes, and adding/removing edges are all built-in.

üíÖüèª **Easily customizable:** Svelte Flow nodes are easily customizable components, made to be tweaked and modified to your heart's content. Svelte Flow is focused on the UI and canvas of your application, you bring the data and layouting libraries.

üîå **Built-in Components:** Background, Minimap, Controls, and Panel components are ready-to-use on install.

## Docs & Examples

We just launched [svelteflow.dev](https://svelteflow.dev) where you can find docs, guides, reference, and a bunch of copy-pasteable code examples, and we'll keep adding new resources and improve the ones that are already there as we continue to maintain the library.

- [Getting Started guide](https://svelteflow.dev/learn/getting-started/installation)
- 20+ Code examples
  - [Dagre Layouting](https://svelteflow.dev/examples/layout/dagre)
  - [Subflows](https://svelteflow.dev/examples/layout/subflows)
  - [Stress test with 450 nodes](https://svelteflow.dev/examples/nodes/stress)
  - [See all 20+ Examples](https://svelteflow.dev/examples)
- [API Reference](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference)
- [Ways to support the project](https://svelteflow.dev/support-us)

## Get running with just a few lines of code

After installing `@xyflow/svelte`, copy-paste this into your project to get to Hello World.

```jsx
<script lang="ts">
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    Controls,
    Background,
    MiniMap,
  } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css'

  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: '1',
      data: { label: 'Hello' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      data: { label: 'World' },
      position: { x: 100, y: 100 }
    }
  ]);

  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: '1-2',
      source: '1',
      target: '2',
    }
  ]);
</script>

<SvelteFlow {nodes} {edges} fitView>
  <Controls />
  <Background />
  <MiniMap />
</SvelteFlow>
```

The result should look like this:

</Bleed>

### And beyond‚Ä¶

Svelte Flow is unopinionated on how you the content of nodes, edges, and handles, so you can do whatever you'd like with them.

## Join in the conversation

We also have an active Discord server where we're talking about Svelte Flow, new features, and reporting bugs. [Join the Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TmAJQbwWDM)

[Sam Lavigne](https://mastodon.social/@samlavigne) has already built a tool using Svelte Flow to help people explore ffmpeg filters in the browser! [Try it out here](https://ffmpeg.lav.io/)

## Who built Svelte Flow?

We are the xyflow team\*, the creators of React Flow and Svelte Flow. We've been maintaining the React Flow library and its ecosystem since 2019. Earlier this year we were inspired by the Svelte community, and created a prototype of what our tool could look like if it was built in Svelte. This lead to us abstracting the core of React Flow to vanilla js and porting the library to Svelte, improving the performance of both libraries along the way.

Now that Svelte Flow is launched, we‚Äôre excited to see how the Svelte community uses the library, and are ready to keep improving it and squash any bugs you find along the way.

See you around and thanks for checking out Svelte Flow ‚úåüèª

\*_until now, we referred to ourselves as the ‚ÄúReact Flow team‚Äù. Now that we‚Äôre not just building React Flow, we‚Äôre now calling ourselves the ‚Äúxyflow team‚Äù. Hi!_
