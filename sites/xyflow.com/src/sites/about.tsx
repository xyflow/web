          in 2019, they developed React Flow and decided to open-source it. More
          and more people started using it, to the point they decided to work on
          it full-time in 2021 to create a sustainable open-source project like
          the many they had used.

          Hayleigh and Peter joined the team to help out with the many things
          that revolve around an open source library. In 2023, we generalized
          the core of React Flow to support other frameworks beyond React. In
          order to keep all of our ducks in a row, we created xyflow to be the
          house where all of our projects could live. Now, here we are- happy
          maintainers of a couple of libraries we&apos;re proud of with
          wonderful communities behind them :)

He quickly rose through the ranks there. Now he codes at xyflow, hoping one day he will remember how he got here, and what the meaning of all this is anyway."

Once he's done editing the footage (he keeps saying 'one more week'), we're hoping he'll make some contributions to the Svelte Flow library and docs."
