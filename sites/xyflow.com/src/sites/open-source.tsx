          We gave the React Flow library an MIT license as soon as we built it
          in 2019. We were lucky to see it organically grow from there, and as
          more people and organizations used it, we wanted to spend more time
          taking care of the library and its ecosystem. In 2022, we set up a
          business model to support our ongoing work on the library and put our
          agency-style work to the side to focus on the library full-time. Since
          then, we&apos;ve been happy maintainers of one of the most popular
          node-based UI libraries.

          because we believe in Free and Open Source Software. Having this
          license means that anyone can use, repurpose, or resell our docs, our
          blog posts, or our library. We love that it allows anyone to use
          xyflow for their own projects, and we get to see people build things
          with xyflow that we never would have imagined. The MIT License also
          allows companies to easily use the library without having to hire a
          lawyer to interpret a custom license. We&apos;ll keep our software MIT
          Licensed forever.

          How we fund our work

        <Text className="text-lg leading-8">
          We need funding to pay for the time it takes to care for xyflow and
          the infrastructure around it. The way we do this is a thin-crust
          open-core model:

        <Image
          src={ossImage}
          alt="A diagram showing a circle with an outline. Inside the circle is the Free, Open Core, which contains Libraries, docs, examples, and discord. The thick outline of the circle is the Paid Crust, containing Pro examples, prioritized bug fixes, and email support."

          className="my-10 mx-auto lg:max-w-[544px] "
        />

        <Text className="text-lg leading-8 mb-4">
          We spend most of our time on the “core,” which is MIT Licensed
          (library, docs, github discussions, discord). We spend less time on
          the “crust,” which is the paid content and services (subscriber
          support, pro examples)– these are handled by our Terms of Use instead
          of the MIT License. This model allows us to decide the direction of
          the library (no investors), the core library remains free for
          everyone, and the financial burden of the library and ecosystem around
          it is placed on organizations who can afford to fund us (rather than
          individual developers).
