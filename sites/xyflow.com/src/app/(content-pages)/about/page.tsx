          in 2019, they created React Flow and decided to open-source it. As adoption
          grew, they began working on it full-time in 2021 to develop it into a
          sustainable open-source project, just like the ones they loved using.

          Today, we&apos;ve expanded the team and generalized the core of React Flow to
          support frameworks beyond React. To keep everything organized, we launched
