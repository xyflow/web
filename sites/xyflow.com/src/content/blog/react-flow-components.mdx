_**Update July 2025**: "React Flow UI" was formerly known as "React Flow Components". We
renamed it because it now includes both components and templates. Additionally, since it's
built on shadcn/ui, the "UI" naming makes it easier for developers to recognize the
connection and understand what we offer. The following text was updated to match the new
naming._

At xyflow we try to pay close attention to the developer experience when using our
libraries or our docs: we have a huge collection of examples, tutorials that walk you
through development from scratch, and
[starter apps on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-flow-starter-ts-r69228).
This great experience starts to fall away once you move to your own apps, though.

Our users have always been excited to show us what they've been building, and over time we
noticed that many React Flow projects are defining similar components in their flows. This
got us thinking: how can we cut down on all the duplicated work folks are doing and make
it easier for our users to hit the ground running?

## The initial idea: a UI library for React Flow

Our first instinct was to build a companion ui package that provides some pre-built nodes
and edges. We had some experience with this in the past, our node resizer component
started as a separate package before being brought into the core library.

On the surface this sounds like a great idea, but after a bit of thinking we realized
there was a big downside to taking this approach. Compared to similar libraries, React
Flow is designed to be fairly low-level and with a high amount of customizability. How
would users customize and style components hidden away inside a library?

After some consideration, we decided this approach wasn't going to work for us for a few
reasons:

- Building flexible, reusable components that could be styled and used across different
  apps would be too complex.

- If users needed features we didn't anticipate, they would have to fork the component
  library and add it themselves; negating a lot of the benefits of us developing a library
  in the first place.

- It's important that React Flow stays our primary focus, and maintaining a separate
  component library would take too much time away from the core library.

## Shadcn and a new approach to component libraries

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) is a component "library" that has been steadily gaining
hype and adoption for some time now. The premise is simple: instead of providing an opaque
package of components, shadcn provides the source code for each component and expects you
to vendor the code into your own projects. It calls back to the days before npm and
bundlers and honestly it can feel quite nice; when we rebuilt our docs site we lent
heavily into shadcn for many of our ui components.

This approach felt like it solved a lot of the problems we had with publishing a
standalone package, and so at the beginning of the year a handful of us got to work trying
to build a collection of components and code snippets that folks could vendor into their
own projects.

        inspect elements in a flow and copy their source code.

    }

We spent a while developing this but eventually decided to shelf the project after we were
dissatisfied with some of the compromises we ended up making along the way.

The biggest open-ended question we kept running into was what to do about _styling_. On
the one hand we wanted to provide components that were easy to use and looked good out of
the box, but on the other hand we couldn't make any assumptions about what styling
approach folks would be taking and we couldn't easily pull in external dependencies
without making the installation process confusing.

Although we had benched the idea, it was a frequent topic of conversation in our team
meetings. We knew the value of shipping _something_ would be high, we just couldn't work
out _how_...

## A new hope: the shadcn CLI

Shadcn has had a simple CLI to install their components into your codebase for a while
now, but more recently the CLI was given the ability to install _external_ components as
long as they followed a simple JSON schema.

This solved a bunch of problems for us:

- All shadcn components use Tailwind CSS, so we can add styles to our components without
  needing to worry about the user installing additional dependencies.

- Shadcn components can depend on _other shadcn components_, so we can build out more
  sophisticated components that take advantage on the great collection of shadcn
  components that already exist.

- These components are vendored into the user's codebase meaning we don't need to worry
  about covering every single use case or feature request: folks can implement what they
  need!

## Introducing React Flow UI

This was the kick we needed to jump into the project again. We've been working hard to
build out a collection of initial components that we think will make it easier for folks
to put together React Flow projects going forward. Some interesting components from the
initial set include:

- A [**database schema node**](https://reactflow.dev/ui/components/database-schema-node)
  that makes it easy to visualize tables and relationships between columns.

  src={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_COMPONENTS_URL}/components/database-schema-node`}
/>

- A [**zoom slider**](https://reactflow.dev/ui/components/zoom-slider) for more convenient
  control over the viewport zoom level.

/>

- [**Debugging components**](https://reactflow.dev/ui/components/devtools) that make it
  easier to inspect a node's properties and the state of your flow.

We've also laid the foundation to build out more advanced components in the future. We're
still not sure if this is something we're going to commit to, so please try out the
components and let us know what you think! You can find the documentation for these
components and a brief guide on how to install them by heading over to
[reactflow.dev/ui](https://reactflow.dev/ui), or you can learn more about shadcn and the
CLI [over on their docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

We're excited to see what you build with these components, and we're looking forward to
hearing your feedback! Please open issues on our
[web repo](https://github.com/xyflow/web/issues) if you run into any problems or have any
suggestions for new components, and definitely tweet at us at
[@xyflowdev](https://x.com/xyflowdev) if you build something cool with them!
