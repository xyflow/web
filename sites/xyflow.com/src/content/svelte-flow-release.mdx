Man, the kids grow up so fast. It feels like yesterday when Svelte Flow was taking its first steps, and then bam – it has become a full-grown library, complaining about our lame music taste...

And like any decent coming-of-age flick, there are some bumps along the way before you see the end credits roll over the sunset. For us, this meant rewriting Svelte Flow **twice** before landing where we are today. And it is better than ever! A good chunk of the glow-up comes from new possiblities in Svelte 5 and the rest comes down to building a Svelte library from the ground up.

While there are many things to unpack about our journey with Svelte 5, that's a story for another day.

### TL;DR

<div style={{ marginTop: -10 }} />

- Lots of new features like reconnecting edges, improved fitView, key navigation, a11y updates and click connect
- Written from the ground up for Svelte 5
- Better DX via TSDoc comments
- Feature parity with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) for present and upcoming features
- Overhauled [learn section](https://svelteflow.dev/learn)
- Automatically generated [API references](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference)

## Wait, what's Svelte Flow?

For everyone who is new to Svelte Flow, it is a Svelte library for building node-based applications like workflow editors, data pipelines or visual programming environments. With just a few lines of code, you get an interactive flow with zoming, panning, connecting nodes and much more.

```svelte filename="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { SvelteFlow, Background, Controls, Minimap } from '@xyflow/svelte';
  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css';

  let nodes = $state.raw([
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'input',
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      data: { label: 'Hello' },
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      type: 'output',
      position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
      data: { label: 'World' },
    },
  ]);

  let edges = $state.raw([
    { id: '1-2', source: '1', target: '2', type: 'smoothstep', label: 'to the' },
  ]);
</script>

<SvelteFlow bind:nodes bind:edges fitView>
  <Background />
  <Controls />
  <Minimap />
</SvelteFlow>
```

# New features and improvements

One of the goals of our first major release, was to close the last remaining gaps between Svelte Flow and React Flow. For us, this also marks a new commitment to develop new features for both libraries in tandem. So keep your eyes peeled for future releases! 👀

- **[Reconnecting Edges]()**: You can reconnect your edges by using the new `<EdgeReconnectAnchor />` component. It can be used to add custom reconnection points on custom edges. Try it out below!
- **Key Navigation & A11y**: We added support for keyboard navigation and improved accessibility for screen readers. You can now navigate through nodes and edges using the arrow keys.
- **[Click Connect]()**: You can now create a new connection by clicking on a handle one by one.
- **[Enhanced Viewport Portal]()**: We added a new `<ViewportPortal />` component that allows you to render content in the viewport of the flow. This is useful for rendering custom overlays or tooltips.
- **Improved fitView**: We finetuned the fitView function to better work with dynamically added nodes.

# Embracing runes

To create a stable API for the future, we fully embraced signals by converting all [stores](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/stores) to [runes](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/what-are-runes). This allowed us to simplify many parts of the library and make it more performant. Here is a quick overview of some changes to keep in mind when upgrading.

## `nodes` & `edges` now use `$state.raw` 🦁

[`$state.raw`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#$state.raw) makes nodes and edges immutable, which [improves performance](https://svelte.dev/playground/e6f804ba6da348bc8b6a0a13c59672cb?version=5.19.0) and allows us to better reason about state updates. Additionally, [binding](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$bindable) expresses the contract behind `nodes` & `edges` passed to `<SvelteFlow />` more explicitly.

**Old API**

```svelte
<script>
  const nodes = writable([...]);
  const edges = writable([...]);

  const updatePosition = () => {
    nodes.forEach((node) => {
      if (node.id === 'someID') {
        node.position.x += 10;
      }
    });
    nodes = nodes;
  };
</script>

<SvelteFlow {nodes} {edges} />
```

**New API**

```svelte
<script>
  let nodes = $state.raw([...]);
  let edges = $state.raw([...]);

  const updatePosition = () => {
    nodes = nodes.map((node) => {
      if (node.id === 'someID') {
        return {
          ...node,
          position: {
            ...node.position,
            x: node.position.x + 10,
          },
        };
      }
      return node;
    });
  };
</script>

<SvelteFlow bind:nodes bind:edges />
```

## Hooks return reactive values instead of `writable`

Many of our hooks that used to return a store, now return a reactive value that can be accessed via `.current`.

```svelte
<script>
  import { useNodeConnections } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  const connections = useNodeConnections({ handleType: 'target', handleId: 'my-handle' });

  $inspect(connections.current);
</script>
```

## Events are lowercase & HTML attributes exposed

Following the new [Svelte 5 convention](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Event-changes), all event callbacks are now lowercase.
Plus, as a result of the [new way rest props](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$props#Rest-props) can be passed on to HTML elements, almost all components now expose the props of the underlying parent element.

```svelte
<!-- Both, Svelte Flow and <div/> callbacks in one place -->
<SvelteFlow
  onnodeclick={handleNodeClick}
  onbeforedelete={handleBeforeDelete}
  onbeforeconnect={handleBeforeConnect}
  [...]
  ondragover={handleDragOver}
  ondrop={handleDrop}
  oncontextmenu={handleContextMenu}
/>
```

# Svelte Flow in the wild

I had a great time mingeling with the community at [Svelte Summit](https://sveltesummit.com/) and even got to chat with people who are already using Svelte Flow! To prove to y'all we are not just pushing some vaporware here, take a look at some of these projects out in the wild!

## [Windmill](https://windmill.dev/)

An open-source developer platform and workflow engine using Svelte Flow to view and edit workflows.

## [Sparrow](https://sparrowapp.dev/)

A collaborative API testing workspace utilizing Svelte Flow for vizualizing shape and status of test runs.

## [Whimsy](https://whimsy.rocks/)

A tiny game engines visual scripting tool is powered by Svelte Flow.
