  The React Flow Playground is an interactive testing ground for all things React Flow. Experiment with
  graph layout algorithms, props, and customize all configurations of flows right in the browser, without writing a single line of code. 
  Build, tweak, and share flows!

Would you like to quickly test out React Flow, and all of its features,
configurations and layout algorithms, before you write a single line of code?

The React Flow Playground is the perfect place to test out new ideas and see how
they work live in practice. On the left, you will find a sidebar where you can
interactively adjust the props that get passed to the React Flow component and
each node. On the right, you will see the flow being rendered in real time,
where you can drag and pan the flow, select nodes and interactively adjust them. 

When you have found the perfect configuration for your new app using React Flow,
you will be able to create a shareable link to your flow, and share it with your
friends and colleagues.

### Interactively tweak `<ReactFlow />` props

The React Flow Playground allows you to interactively adjust the props that get
passed to the main `<ReactFlow />` component. When you hover a prop, you will see a
tooltip with an explanation, and when you tweak its value, you will see the
resulting flow updated in real time.
You can experiment with every configuration option related to the appearance and
interactive behaviors of the flow: color themes, keyboard shortcuts, selection
mode, zooming, panning and much more.

### Node and Edges Editor

When you select a node in the React Flow playground, you will be able to
interactively inspect it. You'll be able to change a node's position, size,
number and position of its handles, and much more. You can also load and save
custom node datasets, play with nested nodes hierarchies, and modify the
interactive behaviors of nodes.

### Layout Algorithms

The React Flow Playground allows you to try out different graph layouting
libraries in the browser before you use them in your project. You can try out 
Dagre, ElkJS and D3 Hierarchy: when you select a layout library, you will be able 
to configure each parameter of the layout algorithm in the sidebar, such as direction, alignment and spacing of nodes in the flow. 
Just as the props editor in the playground, when you hover a parameter, you will see a tooltip with an 
explanation, and when you tweak any parameter, you will see the resulting flow updated in real time.

### Sharing a Flow

So you've found the perfect configuration for your React Flow application, and you'd like to share it with others?
You will be able to create a shareable link to your flow, and share it with your
friends and colleagues.
