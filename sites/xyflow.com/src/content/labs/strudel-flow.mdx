The Strudel Flow project is an experimental UI for the [Strudel live coding platform](https://strudel.cc). 
You can use it to make music with a flow-based interface.
Under the hood, it generates a Strudel program, and executes it in the browser.

### Visual Music Creation

Strudel Flow transforms Strudel's live coding environment into an intuitive node-based
editor. Connect instrument nodes to effect nodes to create complex musical patterns: **no
coding required**.

### How It Works

**Drag & Connect** - Add nodes from the sidebar and connect them to build your musical
workflow

**Real-time Editing** - Modify patterns while they play with visual step sequencers and
effect controls, right inside [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) nodes.  

**Share & Collaborate** - Generate a shareable link to your musical masterpiece, and share it with your friends!

### Node Types

Strudel Flow includes 25+ nodes across four categories:

- **Instruments** - Pad sequencers, beat machines, arpeggiators, chord players
- **Synths** - Drum sounds and sample selection
- **Audio Effects** - Gain, distortion, filtering, spatial processing
- **Time Effects** - Speed changes, delays, pattern manipulation
