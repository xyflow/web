    answer: (
      <>
        React Flow Pro is not an additional library, it is a paid subscription
        around the React Flow open-source library that gives you access to
        exclusive services like Pro examples, individual support from the React
        Flow team or prioritized bug reports.

        library without paying anything.

        With a Pro subscription, we can provide custom examples for your
        specific use case, answer any questions you have about the library, and
        send your team in the right direction in whatever way we can. This

        After unsubscribing, you will no longer be able to access the Pro
        Example code through our website. You will still be able to use React
        Flow as usual and continue receiving updates to the library.
