<ExampleLayout>
If you are working with multiple flows on a page or if you are using a client side router you need to wrap each flow with a [`ReactFlowProvider`](/docs/api/react-flow-provider/) so that every flow has its own store instance.
Using a `ReactFlowProvider` is also mandatory if you want to access the internal state outside of the `ReactFlow` component.

<CodeViewer
  codePath="example-flows/Provider"
  additionalFiles={['Sidebar.js', 'index.css']}
/>
</ExampleLayout>
