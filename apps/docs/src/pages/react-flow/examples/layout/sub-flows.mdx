<ExampleLayout>
React Flow supports rendering nested graphs and grouping of nodes. You can configure the behaviour of the child nodes using `extent: 'parent'` and render group elements without handles by passing `type: 'group'` to the node configuration. See our [Sub Flow guide](/docs/guides/sub-flows) for more information.
