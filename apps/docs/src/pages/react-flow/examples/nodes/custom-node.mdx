This is an example of a custom node implementation. Nodes are just React components so you can display any content and functionality you want. The instructions about how to set up a custom node can be found on the [custom nodes doc page](/docs/guides/custom-nodes/).

<CodeViewer
  codePath="example-flows/CustomNode"
  additionalFiles={['ColorSelectorNode.js', 'index.css']}
