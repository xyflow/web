title: Resize and Rotate

<ExampleLayout>
This example shows how to implement a [custom node](/docs/api/nodes/custom-nodes/) that can be resized and rotated using the [NodeResizer component](/docs/api/nodes/node-resizer). It can be used as a starting point for building flow chart editors or diagrams where users can configure the size and rotation of the elements.

<Callout type="info">
The `NodeResizer` component is **not** part of the `reactflow` package. You need to install it seperately and you need reactflow >= v11.3.3 for this to work.

This used to be a pro example using the [moveable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moveable) library. As React Flow now supports resizing through the [NodeResizer package](/docs/api/nodes/node-resizer), the pro example has been [deprecated](/docs/examples/nodes/resize-rotate-moveable-deprecated).
