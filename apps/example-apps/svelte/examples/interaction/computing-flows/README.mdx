title: Computing Flows
description: Calculate and visualize flow paths between nodes
---

This example shows how to compute and visualize different paths between nodes in your flow. You can use this to implement features like dependency analysis, path finding, or flow validation. The example demonstrates how to use Svelte Flow's built-in utilities to calculate paths and highlight them in the flow.
