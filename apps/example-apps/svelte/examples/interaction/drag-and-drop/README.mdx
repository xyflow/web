A drag and drop user interface is very common for node-based workflow editors. The drag
and drop behavior outside of the Svelte Flow pane is not built in but can be implemented
with the native
[HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)
(used in this example) or a third party library like
[Neodrag](https://www.neodrag.dev/docs/svelte).
