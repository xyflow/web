description: Drag and drop outside of the Svelte Flow pane with native HTML Drag and Drop API or svelte-draggable.

A drag and drop user interface is very common for node-based workflow editors. The drag and drop behavior outside of the Svelte Flow pane is not built in but can be implemented with the native [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) (used in this example) or a third party library like [svelte-draggable](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-draggable).
