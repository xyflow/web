description: Check if a new connection is valid and should be added

Custom nodes need to have at least one
[`Handle` component](/api-reference/components/handle) to be connectable. You can pass a
validation function [`isValidConnection`](/api-reference/svelte-flow#isvalidconnection) to
the SvelteFlow component in order to check if a new connection is valid and should be
added.
