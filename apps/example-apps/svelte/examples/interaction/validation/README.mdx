description: Check if a new connection is valid and should be added

Custom nodes need to have at least one [`Handle` component](/api-reference/components/handle) to be connectable. You can pass a validation function [`isValidConnection`](/api-reference/svelte-flow#isvalidconnection-1) to the SvelteFlow component in order to check if a new connection is valid and should be added.
