title: Edge Types
description: Use different built-in edge types
---

Svelte Flow comes with several built-in edge types: `default` (bezier), `straight`, `step`, and `smoothstep`. This example demonstrates how to use these different edge types and how to switch between them. Each edge type has its own characteristics and is suitable for different visualization needs.
