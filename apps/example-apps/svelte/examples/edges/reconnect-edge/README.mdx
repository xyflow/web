You can make edges reconnectable by using the `<EdgeReconnectAnchor />` component. This component is used to create a reconnection point on your custom edges. They behave similar to handles:

1. You can start dragging on an `<EdgeReconnectAnchor />`
2. This starts a new connection process and from the oppsite side of the edge
3. You can finish the connection the same way as it had been started from a handle
