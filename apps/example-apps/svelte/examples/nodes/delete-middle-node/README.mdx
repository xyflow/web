title: Delete Middle Node
description: Remove a node without breaking the flow
---

This example shows you how to recover deleted edges when you remove a node from the middle
of a chain. In other words, if we have three nodes connected in sequence - `a->b->c` - and
we deleted the middle node `b`, this example shows you how to end up with the graph
`a->c`.

To achieve this, we need to make use of a few bits:

- The [`onbeforedelete`](/api-reference/svelte-flow#onbeforedelete) handler lets us
  intercept and modify the deletion process before nodes are removed.
- [`getConnectedEdges`](/api-reference/utils/get-connected-edges) gives us all the edges
  connected to a node, either as source or target.
- [`getIncomers`](/api-reference/utils/get-incomers) and
  [`getOutgoers`](/api-reference/utils/get-outgoers) give us the nodes connected to a node
  as source or target.

All together, this allows us to take all the nodes connected to the deleted node, and
reconnect them to any nodes the deleted node was connected to.

Although this example is less than 20 lines of code there's quite a lot to digest. Let's
break some of it down:

- Our `onbeforedelete` handler is called with an object containing `nodes` and `edges`
  arrays representing what will be deleted. The `nodes` array contains every node that
  will be deleted. If you select an individual node and press the delete key, it will
  contain just that node, but if you make a selection _all_ the nodes in that selection
  will be included.

- We create a new array of edges - `remainingEdges` - that contains all the edges in the
  flow that have nothing to do with the node(s) we're about to delete.

- We create another array of edges by _flatMapping_ over the array of `incomers`. These
  are nodes that were connected to the deleted node as a source. For each of these nodes,
  we create a new edge that connects to each node in the array of `outgoers`. These are
  nodes that were connected to the deleted node as a target.

- Finally, we return `true` from the callback to allow the deletion to proceed with our
  modified edge array.

<Callout type="info">
For brevity, we're using object destructuring while at the same time renaming
the variable bound (e.g. `({ id: source }) => ...)` destructures the `id`
property of the object and binds it to a new variable called `source`) but you
don't need to do this
</Callout>
