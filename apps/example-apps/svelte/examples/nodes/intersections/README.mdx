title: Intersections
description: Detect when a node overlaps with another node
---

The `useSvelteFlow` hook exports
[helpers to check intersections](/api-reference/hooks/use-svelte-flow#isnodeintersecting)
of nodes and areas. In this example you can drag a node and get a visual feedback when it
intersects with another node.
