description: Update the data field of a specific node
---

You can update properties of nodes and edges freely as long as you pass a newly created `nodes` or `edges` array to `SvelteFlow`.

<Callout type="info">
  You have to create a new `data` object on a node to notify Svelte Flow about data
  changes.
</Callout>
