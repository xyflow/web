title: Custom Nodes
description: Display any content inside of a node

Creating custom nodes is as easy as building a regular Svelte component and passing it to `nodeTypes`. Since they're standard Svelte components, you can display any content and implement any functionality you need. Plus, you'll have access to a range of props that allow you to extend and customize the default node behavior. For more details, check out our [Custom Nodes guide](/learn/customization/custom-nodes).
