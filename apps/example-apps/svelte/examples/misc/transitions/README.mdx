description: Use Sveltes in and out transitions to animate nodes & edges
---

This example shows how to use Svelte's built-in transitions to animate creating and
removing nodes and edges. Since nodes and edges are rendered as normal DOM elements, you
can apply any Svelte transition to them.

Note that you need to use the `|global` modifier with your transitions for them to work
properly within Svelte Flow's component structure.
