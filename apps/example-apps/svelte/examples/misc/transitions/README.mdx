description: Use Sveltes in and out transitions to animate nodes & edges
---

This example shows how to use
[Svelte's built-in transitions](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-transition) to
animate creating and removing nodes and edges. Since nodes and edges are rendered as
normal DOM elements, you can apply any Svelte transition to them.

Note that you need to use the `|global` modifier with your transitions for them to work
properly within Svelte Flow's component structure.
