This example demonstrates how to export your Svelte Flow diagram as an image. Learn how to capture the current view of your flow and save it as a PNG or other image format, which is useful for sharing, documentation, or printing your diagrams.

<Callout type="info">
  The `version` of the [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image)
  package used in this example, has been locked to `1.11.11`, which is the latest working
  `version` for the package. The recent versions, after `1.11.11`, are not exporting
  images properly and there is open
  [issue](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image/issues/516) for this on Github.
