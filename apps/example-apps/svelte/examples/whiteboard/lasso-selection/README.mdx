This example demonstrates how to implement a lasso selection tool that allows users to select multiple nodes by drawing a freehand selection area. The component features:

- **Lasso Drawing**: Draw freehand selection areas using pointer events
- **Partial/Full Selection**: Toggle between selecting nodes partially or fully enclosed by the lasso
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time visual feedback while drawing the selection area
- **Canvas Rendering**: Uses HTML5 Canvas for smooth drawing performance
