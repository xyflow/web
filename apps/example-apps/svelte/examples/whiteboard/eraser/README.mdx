This example shows how to create an eraser tool that allows you to delete nodes and edges by wiping them out.
It's made up of two parts:

1. The `Eraser` component that handles the erasing logic and rendering of the eraser trail.
2. The custom `ErasableNode` and `ErasableEdge` that reacts to the `toBeDeleted` flag.

Determining if the trail intersects with a node is fairly straight forward - however detecting intersections between the trail and an edge is a bit more complex:
We sample points along the edge through the [`getPointAtLength`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGGeometryElement/getPointAtLength) method of the SVG path element,
construct a polyline that we can then use to detect intersections with the eraser trail.
This is a trade-off between performance and accuracy - you can play around with the `sampleDistance` variable to see the effect it has on the eraser trail.
