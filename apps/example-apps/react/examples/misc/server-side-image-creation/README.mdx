description: Generate static images of React Flow graphs on the server with Puppeteer
is_pro_example: true
---

This example demonstrates how to create static images of React Flow graphs on the server side. The application lets you interact with nodes on the left side of the screen while automatically generating and displaying the corresponding flow image on the right. The implementation uses React Flow's new static rendering capabilities combined with Puppeteer to capture screenshots.
