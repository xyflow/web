description: A hook with useful helpers for your nodes, edges, and the viewport

This example illustrates how to use the [`useReactFlow` hook](/api-reference/hooks/use-react-flow). It comes with a lot of useful helpers to update your nodes and edges or adjust the viewport of your diagram. The hook returns a [`ReactFlow instance`](/api-reference/types/react-flow-instance).
