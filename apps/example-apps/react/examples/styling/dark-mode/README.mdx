import { RemoteCodeViewer } from '@/components/remote-code-viewer';

React Flow comes with a built-in light & dark mode. You can set the [`colorMode`](/api-reference/react-flow#colorMode) prop that allows you to switch between `'dark'`, `'light'` and `'system'`.

<RemoteCodeViewer
  route="examples/styling/dark-mode"
  framework="react"
/>
