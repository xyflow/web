This example demonstrates how to implement alignment helper lines. As you drag nodes
around, these visual guides appear automatically to help align nodes with each other,
while a snapping mechanism ensures precise positioning.

The implementation handles both horizontal and vertical alignment and works correctly with
the viewport's transform and scale, ensuring the guides remain accurate even when zoomed
or panned.
