title: Contextual Zoom
description: Only display the content of a node when you are zoomed in close enough
---

This example shows how the current zoom level can be used by a node to decide which content to show.
We are using selecting the zoom via the [`useStore` hook](/api-reference/hooks/use-store) to update our custom node whenever the zoom changes.
