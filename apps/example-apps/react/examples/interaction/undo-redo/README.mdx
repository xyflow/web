This example demonstrates how to implement undo and redo functionality for a React Flow graph. Users can track and revert changes when moving, adding, or deleting nodes and edges. The implementation uses a snapshot-based approach with the `useUndoRedo` hook that manages past and future states, allowing users to navigate through their editing history with button clicks or keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z).
