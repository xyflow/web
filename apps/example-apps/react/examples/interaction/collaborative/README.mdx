This example shows how to build a collaborative graph for multiple users with React Flow
and [yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs). The example can be used as a starting point to
build multi-user flows and editors. Note that the room is not globally shared: to open the
same flow in another tab, you can click the button below, or copy the URL from the "Share"
button inside the flow. **To add new nodes to the flow, right click on the canvas.**
