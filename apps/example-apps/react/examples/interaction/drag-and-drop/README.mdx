title: Drag and Drop
description: Drag and drop outside of the React Flow pane with native pointer events.
---

A drag and drop user interface is very common for node-based workflow editors.
The drag and drop behavior outside of the React Flow pane is not built in but
can be implemented with the native [pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events).

The reason why we use pointer events instead of the HTML Drag and Drop API is that
the HTML Drag and Drop API does not provide support for touch devices.
By using pointer events we can support both touch devices and the mouse.
