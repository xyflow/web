description:
  React Flow emits different events during the connection process. Use this example to get
  an overview of those events and what order they are called in.

React Flow emits different events during the connection process that you can use to update
your UI or your flow in different ways. The example below demonstrates which events are
fired and when.

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/interaction/connection-events" framework="react" />

For a **new connection** created by dragging from a handle, the following events are
called in order:

- [`onConnectStart`](/api-reference/react-flow#onconnectstart) is called with the mouse
  event and an object containing the source node, potentially the source handle id, and
  the handle type.

- [`onConnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#onconnect) is only called when the connection is
  released on a handle that
  [is connectable](/api-reference/components/handle#isconnectable). It is called with a
  complete [connection object](/api-reference/types/connection) containing the source and
  target node, and the source and target handle ids if present.

- [`onConnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#onconnectend) is called when a connection is
  released, regardless of whether it was successful or not. It is called with the mouse
  event.

When an edge is **reconnected** by dragging an existing edge, the following events are
called in order:

- [`onReconnectStart`](/api-reference/react-flow#onreconnectstart) is called when a
  [reconnectable edge](/api-reference/types/edge#reconnectable) is picked up. It is called
  with the mouse event, the edge object that is being reconnected, and the type of the
  stable handle.

- [`onConnectStart`](/api-reference/react-flow#onconnectstart) is called as above.

- [`onReconnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#onreconnect) is called when the edge is
  released on a handle that is [reconnectable](/api-reference/types/edge#reconnectable).
  It is called with the old [edge object](/api-reference/types/edge) and the new
  [connection object](/api-reference/types/connection).

- [`onConnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#onconnectend) is called as above.

- [`onReconnectEnd`](/api-reference/react-flow#onreconnectend) is called when the edge is
  released, regardless of whether the reconnection was successful or not. It is called
  with the mouse event, the edge that was picked up, and the type of the stable handle.

<Callout type="info">
  You can see many of these events in use in our [add node on edge
  drop](/examples/nodes/add-node-on-edge-drop) and [temporary
  edges](/examples/edges/temporary-edges) examples!
