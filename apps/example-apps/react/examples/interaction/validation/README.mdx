import { RemoteCodeViewer } from '@/components/remote-code-viewer';

Custom nodes need to have at least one [`Handle` component](/api-reference/components/handle) to be connectable. You can pass a validation function [`isValidConnection`](/api-reference/react-flow#isvalidconnection-1) to the ReactFlow component in order to check if a new connection is valid and should be added.
