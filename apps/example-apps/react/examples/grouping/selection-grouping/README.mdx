This example demonstrates how to create dynamic node grouping in React Flow. You can select multiple nodes by holding Shift and clicking, then use the "Group Nodes" button in the appearing toolbar to group them together. When a group node is selected, an "Ungroup" button appears that detaches all child nodes. Group nodes are fully resizable and automatically adjust their dimensions based on their child nodes.
