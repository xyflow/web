title: Parent Child Relation
description: Dynamically attach and detach nodes from parent containers with drag and drop functionality
is_pro_example: true
---

This example demonstrates how to dynamically create parent-child relationships between nodes. You can drag a node over a group node to attach it as a child, and use the toolbar's "detach" button to remove it. The implementation handles the complex position calculations needed when transforming absolute positions to parent-relative coordinates.
