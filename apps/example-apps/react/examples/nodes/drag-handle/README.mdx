title: Drag Handle
description: Restrict dragging to a specific part of node
---

You can restrict dragging to a specific part of a node, by specifying a class that will act as a [`dragHandle`](/api-reference/types/node). To prevent specific elements within a drag handle from triggering a drag, you can use the [`nodrag`](/learn/customization/utility-classes#nodrag) class name on those elements.
