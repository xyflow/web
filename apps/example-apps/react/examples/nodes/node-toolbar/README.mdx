title: Node Toolbar
description: A toolbar with buttons appears next to the selected node
---

For many types of applications, having a toolbar or set of controls appear when
a node is selected can be quite useful. It's so useful, in fact, that we've built
the [`<NodeToolbar />`](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar) component to make
it easy to add this functionality to your custom nodes!

<Callout type="info">
  Content in the toolbar is not scaled as you zoom your flow in and out: this
  means it should always be visible.
</Callout>

<RemoteCodeViewer route="examples/nodes/node-toolbar" framework="react" />

For more information on the `<NodeToolbar />` component and its props, check out
the [API reference](/api-reference/components/node-toolbar).
