description: Render Custom Nodes with different shapes that are commonly used in flow charts
is_pro_example: true
---

This example shows how to render [Custom Nodes](/learn/customization/custom-nodes) with different shapes commonly used in flow charts like circles, diamonds, or hexagons. It also showcases how to create a sidebar component, custom minimap nodes, and a node toolbar for changing the color of the shapes.

The example uses a centralized Shape component that renders different SVG paths based on the shape type. By defining node data with `{ type: 'shape', data: { type: 'diamond', color: '#ff0071' }}`, you can control which shape gets rendered and how it appears, all while using a single node type implementation.
