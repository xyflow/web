title: Edge Intersection
description: Detect edge intersections with nodes while dragging.
---

This example shows how you can detect an intersection between a dragged node and an edge.

<Callout type="info">
  The default
  [`interactionWidth`](/api-reference/types/default-edge-options#interaction-width)
  of the edges is set to `75` via the
  [`defaultEdgeOptions`](/api-reference/react-flow#default-edge-options). We set
  a wider interaction area so that we can easily find the edge and node
  intersections.
