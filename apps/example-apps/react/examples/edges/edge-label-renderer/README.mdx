title: Edge Label Renderer
description: Render edge labels as divs on top of edges
---

If you want to escape SVG world within an edge, you can use the [`<EdgeLabelRenderer />`](/api-reference/components/edge-label-renderer). It's a portal component that lets you render edge labels as divs on top of the edges. If you want to add mouse interactions you need to set `pointer-events: all` on the label.
