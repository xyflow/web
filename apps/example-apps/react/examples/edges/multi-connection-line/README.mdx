title: Multi Connection Line
description: Draw multiple connection lines at once from any selected nodes.
---

React Flow typically only allows one connection to be created at a time. This
example builds on the [custom connection line](/examples/edges/custom-connectionline)
example to show how to draw multiple connection lines from any selected nodes at
once.

<Callout type="info">
  Pay attention to the `onConnect` handler. If you forget to include this then
  only one connection will be created even if you have multiple selected nodes!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  This example makes use of the special `internalsSymbol` to access properties
  on a node you won't typically need access to. Properties hidden behind this
  symbol don't have the same stability guarantees as the public API, so use them
  with caution.
