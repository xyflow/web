title: Reconnect Edge
description: Click-drag to move an existing edge from one handle to another
---

An edge is reconnectable by dragging it to another handle if you are using the
[`onReconnect` handler prop](/api-reference/react-flow#edges). The handler gets
called after the edge gets dropped to a new handle. You can use the
[`reconnectEdge`](/api-reference/utils/reconnect-edge) helper function to update your
edges state accordingly.

A couple of properties interact with one another to determine whether an edge is
updatable or not:

- By default the [`edgesReconnectable`](/api-reference/react-flow#edgesReconnectable) is
  set to `true`.

- For edges to actually be draggable, though, it is also necessary to define a
  [`onReconnect`](/api-reference/react-flow#onreconnect) handler.

- Individual edges can refine or override the [`edgesReconnectable`](/api-reference/react-flow#edgesReconnectable)
  prop by setting their [`updatable`](/api-reference/types/edge#updatable) property.

  - `true` means the edge is updatable even if [`edgesReconnectable`](/api-reference/react-flow#edgesReconnectable)

  - `"source"` or `"target"` means the edge is updatable only from the source or
    target handle regardless of the [`edgesReconnectable`](/api-reference/react-flow#edgesReconnectable) prop.

  - `false` means the edge is not updatable even if [`edgesReconnectable`](/api-reference/react-flow#edgesReconnectable)
    is set to `true`.
