title: Elkjs Tree
description: For a more powerful alternative to dagre, you can also use elkjs to layout your graphs

Like our [dagre example](/examples/layout/dagre), this example shows how you can integrate [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) with React Flow for more advanced tree layouts. The code for this example builds a similar tree to the dagre example, but you can look at the reference [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html) to see what you can configure (hint: it's a lot).
