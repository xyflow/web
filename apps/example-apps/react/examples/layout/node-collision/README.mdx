This example demonstrates how to automatically resolve node overlaps. When nodes are
placed too close together or overlap, the algorithm detects these collisions and moves the
nodes apart to maintain visual clarity.

For a deep dive into collision detection algorithms, performance benchmarks, and
comparisons with spatial acceleration structures like Flatbush, check out our
