description: Render nested graphs and group nodes, and configure the behavior of child nodes
---

React Flow supports rendering nested graphs and grouping of nodes. You can configure the behavior of the child nodes using `extent: 'parent'` and render group elements without handles by passing `type: 'group'` to the node configuration. See our [Sub Flow guide](/learn/layouting/sub-flows) for more information.
