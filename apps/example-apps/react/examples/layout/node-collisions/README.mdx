title: Node Collisions
description: Automatically resolve node overlaps using collision detection algorithms

This example demonstrates how to automatically resolve node overlaps. When nodes are
placed too close together or overlap, the algorithm detects these collisions and moves the
nodes apart to maintain visual clarity.

For a deep dive into collision detection algorithms check out our
[blog post on node collisions](https://xyflow.com/blog/node-collision-detection-algorithms).

We also created a [benchmark](https://github.com/xyflow/node-collision-algorithms) to
compare the performance of different approaches and you can see them in action in the
[playground](https://xyflow.com/node-collisions).
