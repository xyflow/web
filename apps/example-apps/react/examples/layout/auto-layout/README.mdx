This example demonstrates how to automatically arrange nodes after adding items from a sidebar, a common UI pattern for workflow editors. It introduces a reusable `useAutoLayout` hook and showcases three popular layout engines that you can switch between at runtime: [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre), [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy), and [elk](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs).
