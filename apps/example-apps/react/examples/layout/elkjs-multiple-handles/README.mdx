title: Elkjs Multiple Handles
description: Use multiple handles with the elkjs layouting engine to reduce edge crossings
---

This example demonstrates how to configure [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) to use specific handles (called 'ports' in elkjs). This is helpful to reduce edge crossings and have more control over the layout. The important things to configure are unique ids for the handles / ports, the actual ports for elkjs with a correct side property and `'org.eclipse.elk.portConstraints' : 'FIXED_ORDER'` for all nodes.
