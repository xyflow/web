title: Horizontal Flow
description: A diagram that flows from left to right
---

A diagram can go from left to right or from top to bottom, but you can also create mixed ones.
For controlling the direction of a diagram you can adjust the handle positions of a node with the [`sourcePosition` and `targetPosition`](/api-reference/types/node) props.
