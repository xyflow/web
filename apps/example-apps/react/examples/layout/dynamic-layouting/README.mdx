title: Dynamic Layouting
description: A self-organizing graph where users add nodes by clicking placeholder elements, and nodes position automatically.
is_pro_example: true
---

This example creates a self-organizing graph where nodes position themselves automatically in a tree-like structure. Key features include:

- **Node creation**: Instead of manually placing or connecting nodes, users click on placeholder elements to add new nodes
- **Multiple interaction points**: Add children by clicking on nodes, convert placeholders into nodes, or insert nodes between existing ones using the "+" button on edges
- **Smart layout algorithm**: When the graph changes, an auto-layout hook powered by `d3-hierarchy` recalculates all positions
- **Smooth transitions**: Nodes animate to their new positions, maintaining visual clarity even as complexity increases
