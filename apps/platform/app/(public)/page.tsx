            <strong>React Flow is open-source MIT-licensed software</strong>, and it will be forever. We are glad to see
            our library enabling thousands of developers as well as organizations like Stripe and Linkedin to build
            their node-based apps. With so many active users, it takes time and effort to maintain React Flow, and we
            canâ€™t do that without your support.
