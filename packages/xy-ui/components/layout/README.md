# xy-ui/components/layout

The components in this directory are used as the main containers for page content.
Nextra will already handle inserting things like our header and footer, so we
use these wrap the content of each page and inject any layout-specific elements.

## Peer dependencies

These layout components often depend on nextra-specific types and hooks. Make
sure you have the following peer dependencies installed:

- `nextra`
- `nextra-theme-docs`
